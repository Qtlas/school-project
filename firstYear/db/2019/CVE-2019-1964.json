The vulnerability is due to improper validation of IPv6 traffic sent through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition while the netstack process restarts. A sustained attack could lead to a reboot of the device.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
