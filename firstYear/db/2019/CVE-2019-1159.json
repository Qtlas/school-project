An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application to take control of an affected system.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.\n", "PRODUIT": "microsoft"}
