{"CVE": "CVE-2019-15790", "CWE": ["CWE-250", "CWE-269"], "DATE": "2020-04-28 00:15:12", "SCORE": 2.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "Apport reads PID files with elevated privileges", "DESC": "Apport reads and writes information on a crashed process to /proc/pid with elevated privileges. Apport then determines which user the crashed process belongs to by reading /proc/pid through get_pid_info() in data/apport. An unprivileged user could exploit this to read information about a privileged running process by exploiting PID recycling. This information could then be used to obtain ASLR offsets for a process with an existing memory corruption vulnerability. The initial fix introduced regressions in the Python Apport library due to a missing argument in Report.add_proc_environ in apport/report.py. It also caused an autopkgtest failure when reading /proc/pid and with Python 2 compatibility by reading /proc maps. The initial and subsequent regression fixes are in 2.20.11-0ubuntu16, 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.6, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.12, 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.22 and 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm3.", "PRODUIT": "apport_project"}
