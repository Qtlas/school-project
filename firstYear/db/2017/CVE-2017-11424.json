{"CVE": "CVE-2017-11424", "CWE": ["NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2017-08-24 16:29:00", "SCORE": 5.0, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in `HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account for all PEM encoded public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.", "PRODUIT": "debian"}
