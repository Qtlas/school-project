{"CVE": "CVE-2017-9859", "CWE": ["CWE-327"], "DATE": "2017-08-05 17:29:00", "SCORE": 5.0, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The inverters make use of a weak hashing algorithm to encrypt the password for REGISTER requests. This hashing algorithm can be cracked relatively easily. An attacker will likely be able to crack the password using offline crackers. This cracked password can then be used to register at the SMA servers. NOTE: the vendor's position is that \"we consider the probability of the success of such manipulation to be extremely low.\" Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected", "PRODUIT": "sma"}
