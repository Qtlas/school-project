{"CVE": "CVE-2017-16381", "CWE": ["CWE-119"], "DATE": "2017-12-09 06:29:01", "SCORE": 9.3, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer access with an incorrect length value when processing TIFF files embedded within an XPS document. Crafted TIFF image input causes a mismatch between allocated buffer size and the access allowed by the computation. If an attacker can adequately control the accessible memory then this vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.", "PRODUIT": "adobe"}
