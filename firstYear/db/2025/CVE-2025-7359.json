This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server. NOTE: This particular vulnerability deletes all the files in a targeted arbitrary directory rather than a specified arbitrary file, which can lead to loss of data or a denial of service condition.", "PRODUIT": ""}
