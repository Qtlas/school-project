This is due to the plugin exposing sensitive Algolia API keys through the frontend JavaScript code via wp_localize_script without proper access restrictions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive API keys in the page source, which could be leveraged to make unauthorized API calls to the configured Algolia search service.", "PRODUIT": ""}
