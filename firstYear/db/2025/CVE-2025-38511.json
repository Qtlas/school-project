But beyond that valid range\nwe might leave some stale data that could either point to some\nother VFs allocations or even to the PF pages.\n\nExplicitly clear all new LMTT page to avoid the risk that a\nmalicious VF would try to exploit that gap.\n\nWhile around add asserts to catch any undesired PTE overwrites\nand low-level debug traces to track LMTT PT life-cycle.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 3fae6918a3e27cce20ded2551f863fb05d4bef8d)", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
