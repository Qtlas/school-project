The SAML authentication handler processes XML input without disabling external entity resolution, allowing crafted SAML responses to invoke external entity references. This could enable attackers to retrieve sensitive files or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF). The issue was addressed by disabling external entity processing for the affected XML parser in versions SE.2025.1 and 2025.1.2.", "PRODUIT": ""}
