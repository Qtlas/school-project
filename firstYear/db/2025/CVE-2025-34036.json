The web interface fails to sanitize input in the URI path passed to the language extraction functionality. When the server processes a request to /language/[lang]/index.html, it uses the [lang] input unsafely in a tar extraction command without proper escaping. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject shell commands and achieve arbitrary command execution as root.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-06 UTC.", "PRODUIT": "tvt"}
