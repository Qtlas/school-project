{"CVE": "CVE-2025-24369", "CWE": ["CWE-807"], "DATE": "2025-01-27 23:15:11", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Anubis has a bot protection bypass when a sophisticated attacker asks to pass a challenge of difficulty 0", "DESC": "Anubis is a tool that allows administrators to protect bots against AI scrapers through bot-checking heuristics and a proof-of-work challenge to discourage scraping from multiple IP addresses. Anubis allows attackers to bypass the bot protection by requesting a challenge, formulates any nonce (such as 42069), and then passes the challenge with difficulty zero. Commit e09d0226a628f04b1d80fd83bee777894a45cd02 fixes this behavior by not using a client-specified difficulty value.", "PRODUIT": ""}
