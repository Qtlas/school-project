Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Grav\u2019s Admin plugin due to the absence of username uniqueness validation when creating users. A user with the create user permission can create a new account using the same username as an existing administrator account, set a new password/email, and then log in as that administrator. This effectively allows privilege escalation from limited user-manager permissions to full administrator access. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.", "PRODUIT": "getgrav"}
