The flaw manifests when Unicode tag characters are submitted to the Server field on the login page. The application fails to properly handle these characters during the ASCII conversion process, resulting in an unhandled exception that terminates the application within four to five seconds of submission. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.2.", "PRODUIT": "joni1802"}
