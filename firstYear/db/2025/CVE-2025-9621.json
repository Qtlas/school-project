This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpcmt_sync action in the wpcmt_request_handler function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger comment synchronization events via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "PRODUIT": ""}
