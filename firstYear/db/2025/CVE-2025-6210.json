This flaw permits attackers to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive system files, such as /etc/passwd, by exploiting hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in the load_data() method, where the security checks fail to differentiate between real files and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in version 0.5.2.", "PRODUIT": "llamaindex"}
