This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Hugging Face Transformers. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must convert a malicious checkpoint.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the convert_config function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute Python code. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-28253.", "PRODUIT": ""}
