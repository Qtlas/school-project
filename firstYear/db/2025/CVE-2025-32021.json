Prior to version 5.11, when creating a new component from an existing component that has a source code repository URL specified in settings, this URL is included in the client's URL parameters during the creation process. If, for example, the source code repository URL contains GitHub credentials, the confidential PAT and username are shown in plaintext and get saved into browser history. Moreover, if the request URL is logged, the credentials are written to logs in plaintext. If using Weblate official Docker image, nginx logs the URL and the token in plaintext. This issue is patched in version 5.11.", "PRODUIT": "weblate"}
