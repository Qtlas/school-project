This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to one on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.", "PRODUIT": "a3rev"}
