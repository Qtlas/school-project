The backend fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the strOpid parameter, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL statements. This can lead to data exfiltration, authentication bypass, and potentially remote code execution, depending on backend configuration.\u00a0The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to June 2025 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range remains undefined.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-23 UTC.", "PRODUIT": ""}
