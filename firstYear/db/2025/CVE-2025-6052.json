If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn\u2019t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.", "PRODUIT": "gnome"}
