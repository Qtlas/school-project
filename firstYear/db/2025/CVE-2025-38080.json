This\noverflows the block_sequence buffer and corrupts block_sequence_steps,\ncausing a crash.\n\n[How]\nExpand block_sequence to 100 items. A naive upper bound on the possible\nnumber of steps for a 6-pipe asic, ignoring the potential for steps to be\nmutually exclusive, is 91 with current code, therefore 100 is sufficient.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
