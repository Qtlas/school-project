This occurs because file extension and size validations are enforced solely on the client side. An attacker can intercept the upload request and modify a parameter to bypass extension restrictions and upload arbitrary files. NOTE: this is a third-party component that is not supplied or supported by OutSystems.", "PRODUIT": "multiple_file_upload_project"}
