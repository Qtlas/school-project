All versions of Promptcraft Forge Studio sanitize user input using regex blacklists such as r`eplace(/javascript:/gi, '')`. Because the package uses multi-character tokens and each replacement is applied only once, removing one occurrence can create a new dangerous token due to overlap. The \u201csanitized\u201d value may still contain an executable payload when used in href/src (or injected into the DOM). There is currently no fix for this issue.", "PRODUIT": ""}
