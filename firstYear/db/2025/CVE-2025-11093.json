Authenticated users with elevated privileges can execute arbitrary code within the integration runtime environment.\n\nBy default, access to these scripting engines is limited to administrators in WSO2 Micro Integrator and WSO2 Enterprise Integrator, while in WSO2 API Manager, access extends to both administrators and API creators. This may allow trusted-but-privileged users to perform unauthorized actions or compromise the execution environment.", "PRODUIT": "wso2"}
