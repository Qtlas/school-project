Some treat the\niterator as struct rv_monitor *, while others treat the iterator as struct\nlist_head *.\n\nThis causes a wrong type cast and crashes the system as reported by Nathan.\n\nConvert everything to use struct list_head * as iterator. This also makes\nenabled_monitors consistent with available_monitors.", "PRODUIT": ""}
