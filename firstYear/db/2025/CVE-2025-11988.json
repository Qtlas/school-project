This is due to the plugin registering an unauthenticated AJAX action (wp_ajax_nopriv_crypto_connect_ajax_process) that allows calling the crypto_delete_json method with only a publicly-available nonce check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete specific JSON files matching the pattern *_pending.json within the wp-content/uploads/yak/ directory, causing data loss and denial of service for plugin workflows that rely on these artifacts.", "PRODUIT": ""}
