To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a race condition with handling system files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing specific operations on the file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite system files, which could lead to the device being in an inconsistent state and cause a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
