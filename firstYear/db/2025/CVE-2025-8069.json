If an admin user starts the AWS Client VPN client installation process, that code could be executed with root-level privileges. This issue does not affect Linux or Mac devices. \n\nWe recommend users discontinue any new installations of AWS Client VPN on Windows prior to version 5.2.2.", "PRODUIT": ""}
