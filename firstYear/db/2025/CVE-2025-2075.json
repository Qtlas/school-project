This is due to add_role() and user_role() functions missing proper capability checks performed through the validate_rest_call() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set the role of arbitrary users to administrator granting full access to the site, though privilege escalation requires an active account on the site so this is considered an authenticated privilege escalation.", "PRODUIT": "uncannyowl"}
