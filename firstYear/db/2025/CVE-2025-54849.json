A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to a denial of service. An attacker can send a sequence of unauthenticated packets to trigger this vulnerability.An attacker can trigger this denial-of-service condition by sending a single Modbus TCP message to port 502 using the Write Single Register function code (6) to write the value 1 to register 4352. This action changes the Modbus address to 15. After this message is sent, the device will be in a denial-of-service state.", "PRODUIT": "socomec"}
