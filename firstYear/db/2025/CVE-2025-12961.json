This is due to the absence of any capability verification in the `dlpn_save_settings()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to arbitrarily modify plugin settings including display text, download links, button colors, and other visual customizations.", "PRODUIT": ""}
