However, if we later reduced the plaintext data length\nvia socket policy, we failed to recalculate the ciphertext length.\n\nThis results in transmitting buffers containing uninitialized data during\nciphertext transmission.\n\nThis causes uninitialized bytes to be appended after a complete\n\"Application Data\" packet, leading to errors on the receiving end when\nparsing TLS record.", "PRODUIT": ""}
