{"CVE": "CVE-2025-10456", "CWE": ["CWE-190"], "DATE": "2025-09-19 06:15:34", "SCORE": 7.1, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "TITLE": "Bluetooth: Semi-Arbitrary ability to make the BLE Target send disconnection requests", "DESC": "A vulnerability was identified in the handling of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fixed channels (such as SMP or ATT). Specifically, an attacker could exploit a flaw that causes the BLE target (i.e., the device under attack) to attempt to disconnect a fixed channel, which is not allowed per the Bluetooth specification. This leads to undefined behavior, including potential assertion failures, crashes, or memory corruption, depending on the BLE stack implementation.", "PRODUIT": "zephyrproject"}
