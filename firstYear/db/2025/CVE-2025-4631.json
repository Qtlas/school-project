This makes it possible to trigger the save_object_as_user() function for objects whose '_datatype' is set to 'users',. This allows unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary strings straight into the user\u2019s wp_capabilities meta field, potentially elevating the privileges of an existing user account or a newly created one to that of an administrator.", "PRODUIT": ""}
