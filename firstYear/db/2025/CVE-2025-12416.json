This is due to missing nonce validation on the pr_save_settings() function and insufficient input sanitization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the plugin's settings page.", "PRODUIT": ""}
