This is due to the plugin using eval() to execute user-supplied input from the 'Conditional Tags' setting without proper validation or sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. In WordPress multisite installations, this allows Site Administrators to execute arbitrary code, a capability they should not have since plugin/theme file editing is disabled for non-Super Admins in multisite environments.", "PRODUIT": ""}
