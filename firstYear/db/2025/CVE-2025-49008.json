{"CVE": "CVE-2025-49008", "CWE": ["CWE-78", "CWE-88"], "DATE": "2025-06-05 01:15:21", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Atheos Improper Input Validation Vulnerability Enables RCE in Common.php", "DESC": "Atheos is a self-hosted browser-based cloud integrated development environment. Prior to version 6.0.4, improper use of `escapeshellcmd()` in `/components/codegit/traits/execute.php` allows argument injection, leading to arbitrary command execution. Atheos administrators and users of vulnerable versions are at risk of data breaches or server compromise. Version 6.0.4 introduces a `Common::safe_execute` function that sanitizes all arguments using `escapeshellarg()` prior to execution and migrated all components potentially vulnerable to similar exploits to use this new templated execution system.", "PRODUIT": ""}
