The '/var/www/app/console_release/hp/badgeSetup.php' script is reachable from the Internet without any authentication and builds URLs from user\u2011controlled parameters before invoking either the custom processCurl() function or PHP\u2019s file_get_contents(); in both cases the hostname/URL is taken directly from the request with no whitelist, scheme restriction, IP\u2011range validation, or outbound\u2011network filtering. Consequently, any unauthenticated attacker can force the server to issue arbitrary HTTP requests to internal resources. This enables internal network reconnaissance, credential leakage, pivoting, and data exfiltration.\u00a0This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.", "PRODUIT": "vasion"}
