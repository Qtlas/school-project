The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting length of the name.\r\n\r\nThis resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.", "PRODUIT": ""}
