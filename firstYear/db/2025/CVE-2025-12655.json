This is due to the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/hippoo/v1/wc/token/save_callback/{token_id}` being registered with `permission_callback => '__return_true'`, which allows unauthenticated access. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary JSON content to the server's publicly accessible upload directory via the vulnerable endpoint.", "PRODUIT": ""}
