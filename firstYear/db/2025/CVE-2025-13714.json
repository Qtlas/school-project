This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tencent MedicalNet. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the generate_model function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-27192.", "PRODUIT": ""}
