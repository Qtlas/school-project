This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Allegra. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the extractFileFromZip method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-26524.", "PRODUIT": "alltena"}
