This function was used in project directory launching (core.lua), drag-and-drop file handling (rootview.lua), and the \u201copen in system\u201d command in the treeview plugin (treeview.lua). If an attacker could influence input to system.exec, they might execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Lite XL process.", "PRODUIT": "lite-xl"}
