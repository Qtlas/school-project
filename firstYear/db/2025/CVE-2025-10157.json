This is possible because the scanner performs an exact match for module names, allowing malicious payloads to be loaded via submodules of dangerous packages (e.g., 'asyncio.unix_events' instead of 'asyncio'). \n\nWhen the incorrectly considered safe file is loaded after scan, it can lead to the execution of malicious code.", "PRODUIT": "mmaitre314"}
