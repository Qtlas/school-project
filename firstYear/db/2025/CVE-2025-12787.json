This is due to the plugin's \"tfhb_meeting_form_submit_callback\" function using insufficiently random values to generate booking cancellation tokens, combined with a globally shared nonce. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to cancel arbitrary bookings via brute force attacks against the tfhb_meeting_form_cencel AJAX endpoint.", "PRODUIT": ""}
