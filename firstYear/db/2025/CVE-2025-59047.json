In matrix-sdk-base before 0.14.1, calling the `RoomMember::normalized_power_level()` method can cause a panic if a room member has a power level of `Int::Min`. The issue is fixed in matrix-sdk-base 0.14.1. The affected method isn\u2019t used internally, so avoiding calling `RoomMember::normalized_power_level()` prevents the panic.", "PRODUIT": ""}
