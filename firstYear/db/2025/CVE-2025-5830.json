This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial EV chargers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of DLB_SlaveRegister messages. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26327.", "PRODUIT": "autel"}
