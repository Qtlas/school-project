Prior to version 2025.3.0, the \"Link Bouncer\" functionality attempts to filter javascript URIs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), however this can be bypassed. There is an \"early allow\" code path that happens before the URI's protocol/scheme is checked, which a maliciously crafted URI can follow. This issue has been patched in version 2025.3.0.", "PRODUIT": "xwiki"}
