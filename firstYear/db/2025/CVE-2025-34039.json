The servlet allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via the bsh.script parameter. This can be exploited to run system commands and ultimately gain full control over the target server. The issue is rooted in a third-party JAR component bundled with the application, and the servlet is accessible without authentication on vulnerable installations.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-05 UTC.", "PRODUIT": ""}
