{"CVE": "CVE-2025-62172", "CWE": ["CWE-79", "CWE-80"], "DATE": "2025-10-14 16:15:41", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Home Assistant vulnerable to Stored XSS in Energy dashboard from Energy Entity Name", "DESC": "Home Assistant is open source home automation software that puts local control and privacy first. In versions 2025.1.0 through 2025.10.1, the energy dashboard is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. An authenticated user can inject malicious JavaScript code into an energy entity's name field, which is then executed when any user hovers over data points in the energy dashboard graph tooltips. The vulnerability exists because entity names containing HTML are not properly sanitized before being rendered in graph tooltips. This could allow an attacker with authentication to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions. Additionally, if an energy provider (such as Tibber) supplies a malicious default name for an entity, the vulnerability can be exploited without direct user action when the default name is used. This issue has been patched in version 2025.10.2. No known workarounds exist.", "PRODUIT": ""}
