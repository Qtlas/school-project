{"CVE": "CVE-2016-6581", "CWE": ["CWE-399"], "DATE": "2017-01-10 15:59:00", "SCORE": 7.8, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK library between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack, specifically a so-called \"HPACK Bomb\" attack. This attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.", "PRODUIT": "python"}
