We partially solved this issue with commit ac03046ece2b\n(\"vsock/virtio: free packets during the socket release\"), but we\nforgot to drain the RX queue when the socket is definitely closed by\nthe scheduled work.\n\nTo avoid future issues, let's use the new virtio_transport_remove_sock()\nto drain the RX queue before removing the socket from the af_vsock lists\ncalling vsock_remove_sock().\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=24452624fc4c571eedd9", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
