{"CVE": "CVE-2021-43396", "CWE": ["NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2021-11-04 20:15:09", "SCORE": 7.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "In iconvdata/iso-2022-jp-3.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) 2.34, remote attackers can force iconv() to emit a spurious '\\0' character via crafted ISO-2022-JP-3 data that is accompanied by an internal state reset. This may affect data integrity in certain iconv() use cases. NOTE: the vendor states \"the bug cannot be invoked through user input and requires iconv to be invoked with a NULL inbuf, which ought to require a separate application bug to do so unintentionally. Hence there's no security impact to the bug.", "PRODUIT": "gnu"}
