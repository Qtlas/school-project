{"CVE": "CVE-2021-41101", "CWE": ["CWE-79"], "DATE": "2021-09-30 20:15:07", "SCORE": 5.7, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` settings are too lenient", "DESC": "wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure collaboration platform. Before version 2.106.0, the CORS ` Access-Control-Allow-Origin ` header set by `nginz` is set for all subdomains of `.wire.com` (including `wire.com`). This means that if somebody were to find an XSS vector in any of the subdomains, they could use it to talk to the Wire API using the user's Cookie. A patch does not exist, but a workaround does. To make sure that a compromise of one subdomain does not yield access to the cookie of another, one may limit the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to apps that actually require the cookie (account-pages, team-settings and the webapp).", "PRODUIT": "wire"}
