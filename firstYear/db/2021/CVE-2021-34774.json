This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to a specific API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the users of the application, including security questions and answers. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need valid Administrator credentials. Cisco expects to release software updates that address this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
