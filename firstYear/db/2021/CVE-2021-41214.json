In affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.ragged.cross` has an undefined behavior due to binding a reference to `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "PRODUIT": "google"}
