This is due to the fact that there\nisn't a q_vector associated with the test ring when it is setup as\ninterrupts are not normally added to the test rings.\n\nTo address this I have added code that will check for a q_vector before\nreturning a napi_id value. If a q_vector is not present it will return a\nvalue of 0.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
