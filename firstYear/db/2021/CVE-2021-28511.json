The impact of this vulnerability is that the security ACL drop rule might be bypassed if a NAT ACL rule filter with permit action matches the packet flow. This could allow a host with an IP address in a range that matches the range allowed by a NAT ACL and a range denied by a Security ACL to be forwarded incorrectly as it should have been denied by the Security ACL. This can enable an ACL bypass.", "PRODUIT": "arista"}
