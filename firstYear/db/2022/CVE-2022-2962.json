{"CVE": "CVE-2022-2962", "CWE": ["CWE-400", "CWE-662"], "DATE": "2022-09-13 20:15:09", "SCORE": 7.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the Tulip device emulation in QEMU. When Tulip reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx frame, it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO handlers multiple times, possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.", "PRODUIT": "qemu"}
