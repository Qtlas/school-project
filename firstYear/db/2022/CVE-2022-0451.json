These headers may be explicitly set and contain sensitive information. By default, HttpClient handles redirection logic. If a request is sent to example.com with authorization header and it redirects to an attackers site, they might not expect attacker site to receive authorization header. We recommend updating the Dart SDK to version 2.16.0 or beyond.", "PRODUIT": "dart"}
