When establishing a server-mode `TLSSocket` using `fs2-io` on Node.js, the parameter `requestCert = true` is ignored, peer certificate verification is skipped, and the connection proceeds. The vulnerability is limited to: 1. `fs2-io` running on Node.js. The JVM TLS implementation is completely independent. 2. `TLSSocket`s in server-mode. Client-mode `TLSSocket`s are implemented via a different API. 3. mTLS as enabled via `requestCert = true` in `TLSParameters`. The default setting is `false` for server-mode `TLSSocket`s. It was introduced with the initial Node.js implementation of fs2-io in 3.1.0. A patch is released in v3.2.11. The requestCert = true parameter is respected and the peer certificate is verified. If verification fails, a SSLException is raised. If using an unpatched version on Node.js, do not use a server-mode TLSSocket with requestCert = true to establish a mTLS connection.", "PRODUIT": "typelevel"}
