The VM_PFNMAP\npath is broken as it assumes that vm_pgoff is the base pfn of the mapped\nVMA range, which is conceptually wrong as vm_pgoff is the offset relative\nto the file and has nothing to do with the pfn.  The horrific hack worked\nfor the original use case (backing guest memory with /dev/mem), but leads\nto accessing \"random\" pfns for pretty much any other VM_PFNMAP case.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
