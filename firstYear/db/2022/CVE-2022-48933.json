We must call ->destroy function of the object.\n\nnft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,\nbut the update path doesn't increment it.\n\nTo avoid special-casing the update object release, do module_get for\nthe update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
