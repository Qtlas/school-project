Since vmbus can be built\nas module, it is required that the driver handles both registering and\nunregistering such panic notifier callback.\n\nAfter commit 74347a99e73a (\"x86/Hyper-V: Unload vmbus channel in hv panic callback\")\nthough, the panic notifier registration is done unconditionally in the module\ninitialization routine whereas the unregistering procedure is conditionally\nguarded and executes only if HV_FEATURE_GUEST_CRASH_MSR_AVAILABLE capability\nis set.\n\nThis patch fixes that by unconditionally unregistering the panic notifier\nin the module's exit routine as well.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
