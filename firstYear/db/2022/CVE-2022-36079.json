{"CVE": "CVE-2022-36079", "CWE": ["CWE-200", "NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2022-09-07 21:15:08", "SCORE": 8.6, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "Parse Server vulnerable to brute force guessing of user sensitive data via search patterns", "DESC": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround, implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the query constraints.", "PRODUIT": "parseplatform"}
