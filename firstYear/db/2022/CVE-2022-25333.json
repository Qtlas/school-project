However, only the module header authenticity is validated. An adversary can re-use any correctly signed header and append a forged payload, to be encrypted using the CEK (obtainable through CVE-2022-25332) in order to obtain arbitrary code execution in secure context. This constitutes a full break of the TEE security architecture.", "PRODUIT": "ti"}
