This issue would affect users of shared computers more (especially if cookies are not cleared), due to a lack of root session validation, and the reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions. This enables an attacker to resolve a user session attached to a previously authenticated user; when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued a token for the original user.", "PRODUIT": "redhat"}
