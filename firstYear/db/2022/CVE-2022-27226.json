The cronjob will consequently execute the entry on the threat actor's defined interval, leading to remote code execution, allowing the threat actor to gain filesystem access. In addition, if the router's default credentials aren't rotated or a threat actor discovers valid credentials, remote code execution can be achieved without user interaction.", "PRODUIT": "irz"}
