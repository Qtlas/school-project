An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an XMPP messaging server and sending crafted XMPP messages to an affected Jabber client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages, possibly allowing the attacker to cause the Jabber client application to perform unsafe actions.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
