An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to read sensitive information about the target system.</p>\n<p>To exploit this condition, an authenticated attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the AD|DNS service. Note that the information disclosure vulnerability by itself would not be sufficient for an attacker to compromise a system. However, an attacker could combine this vulnerability with additional vulnerabilities to further exploit the system.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) handles objects in memory.</p>\n", "PRODUIT": "microsoft"}
