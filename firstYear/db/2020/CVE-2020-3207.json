This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation checks while processing boot options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying device boot options to execute attacker-provided code. A successful exploit may allow an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot process and execute malicious code on an affected device with root-level privileges.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
