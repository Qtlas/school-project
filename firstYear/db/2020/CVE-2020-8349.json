This interface is disabled by default and not vulnerable unless enabled. When enabled, it is only vulnerable where attached to a VRF and as allowed by defined ACLs. Lenovo strongly recommends upgrading to a non-vulnerable CNOS release. Where not possible, Lenovo recommends disabling the REST API management interface or restricting access to the management VRF and further limiting access to authorized management stations via ACL.", "PRODUIT": "lenovo"}
