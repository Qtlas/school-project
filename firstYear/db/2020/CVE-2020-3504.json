The vulnerability is due to improper handling of CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing specific commands on the local-mgmt CLI on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause internal system processes to fail to terminate properly, which could result in a buildup of stuck processes and lead to slowness in accessing the UCS Manager CLI and web UI. A sustained attack may result in a restart of internal UCS Manager processes and a temporary loss of access to the UCS Manager CLI and web UI.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
