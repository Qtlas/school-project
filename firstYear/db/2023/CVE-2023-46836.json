It was believed that the\nmitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled.\n\nHowever, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left\ninterrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one\nconditionally on whether XPTI was active.\n\nAs BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations\nare not active together by default.  Therefore, there is a race\ncondition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections\nand launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.\n", "PRODUIT": "xen"}
