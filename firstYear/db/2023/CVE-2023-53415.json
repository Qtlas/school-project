To make things simpler, just\ncall debugfs_lookup_and_remove() instead which handles all of the logic\nat once.\n\nNote, the root dentry for the debugfs directory for the device needs to\nbe saved so we don't have to keep looking it up, which required a bit\nmore refactoring to properly create and remove it when needed.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
