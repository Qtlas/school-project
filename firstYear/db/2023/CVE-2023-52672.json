See the reproducer in [1].\n\nThe commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a different\nfunction, doing that moved the wakeup for pipe->wr_wait before actually\nraising pipe->max_usage. If a pipe was full before the resize occured it\nwould result in the wakeup never actually triggering pipe_write.\n\nSet @max_usage and @nr_accounted before waking writers if this isn't a\nwatch queue.\n\n[Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>: rewrite to account for watch queues]", "PRODUIT": "debian"}
