Hence if the overlay fails to apply due to an\nunresolved symbol, the overlay_changeset.cset.entries list is still\nuninitialized, and cleanup will crash with a NULL-pointer dereference in\noverlay_removal_is_ok().\n\nFix this by moving the call to of_changeset_init() from\ninit_overlay_changeset() to of_overlay_fdt_apply(), where all other\nearly initialization is done.", "PRODUIT": ""}
