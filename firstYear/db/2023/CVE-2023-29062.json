This is possible through the use of LLMNR, MBT-NS, or MDNS and will result in NTLMv2 hashes being sent to a malicious entity position on the local network. These hashes can subsequently be attacked through brute force and cracked if a weak password is used. This attack would only apply to domain joined systems.", "PRODUIT": "bd"}
