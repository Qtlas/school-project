This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The shortcode is not displayed to administrators, so it cannot be used against administrator users.", "PRODUIT": "cmc3215"}
