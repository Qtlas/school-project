This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the login URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a site that is under the control of the attacker, allowing the attacker to modify the login URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to intercept a successful SAML assertion and use that assertion to establish a remote access VPN session toward the affected device with the identity and permissions of the hijacked user, resulting in access to the protected network.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
