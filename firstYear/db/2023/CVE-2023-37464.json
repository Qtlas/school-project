The AES GCM decryption routine incorrectly uses the Tag length from the actual Authentication Tag provided in the JWE. The spec  says that a fixed length of 16 octets must be applied. Therefore this bug allows an attacker to provide a truncated Authentication Tag and to modify the JWE accordingly. Users should upgrade to a version >= 0.6.2.2. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using AES GCM encryption and replace it with another encryption algorithm (e.g. AES CBC).", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
