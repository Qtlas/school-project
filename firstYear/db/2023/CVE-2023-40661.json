To take advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow \r\ncompromise key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.", "PRODUIT": "opensc_project"}
