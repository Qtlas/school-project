When a user registers itself through registration flow, the \"password\" and \"password-confirm\" field from the form will occur as regular user attributes. All users and clients with proper rights and roles are able to read users attributes, allowing a malicious user with minimal access to retrieve the users passwords in clear text, jeopardizing their environment.", "PRODUIT": "redhat"}
