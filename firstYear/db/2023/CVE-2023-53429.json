But if that end I/O handler sets the PageError bit,\nand the submitter checks it, the bit could in some cases leak into the\nsubmission context for fast enough I/O.\n\nFix this by simply not checking PageError and just using the local\nret variable to check for submission errors.  This also fundamentally\nsolves the long problem documented in a comment in __extent_writepage\nby never leaking the error bit into the submission context.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
