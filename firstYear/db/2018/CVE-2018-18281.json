{"CVE": "CVE-2018-18281", "CWE": ["CWE-459"], "DATE": "2018-10-30 18:29:00", "SCORE": 4.6, "METRIC": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and reused. This is fixed in the following kernel versions: 4.9.135, 4.14.78, 4.18.16, 4.19.", "PRODUIT": "canonical"}
