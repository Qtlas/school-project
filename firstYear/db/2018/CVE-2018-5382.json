{"CVE": "CVE-2018-5382", "CWE": ["CWE-327", "CWE-354"], "DATE": "2018-04-16 14:29:01", "SCORE": 4.4, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Bouncy Castle BKS-V1 keystore files vulnerable to trivial hash collisions", "DESC": "The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people need to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type \"BKS-V1\" was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of \"BKS-V1\" is discouraged by the library authors and should only be used where it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going to cause a security issue in itself.", "PRODUIT": "bouncycastle"}
