First, suppose that the owner adds the evil contract address to his sweepers. The evil contract looks like this: contract Exploit { uint public start; function sweep(address _token, uint _amount) returns (bool) { start = 0x123456789; return true;} }. Then, when one calls the function sweep() in the UserWallet contract, it will change the sweeperList to 0X123456789.", "PRODUIT": "userwallet_project"}
