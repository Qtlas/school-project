{"CVE": "CVE-2024-53981", "CWE": ["CWE-770"], "DATE": "2024-12-02 16:15:14", "SCORE": 7.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "TITLE": "python-multipart has a Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary", "DESC": "python-multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When parsing form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \\r or LF \\n) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.18.", "PRODUIT": ""}
