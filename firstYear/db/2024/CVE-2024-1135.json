{"CVE": "CVE-2024-1135", "CWE": ["CWE-444"], "DATE": "2024-04-16 00:15:07", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "HTTP Request Smuggling in benoitc/gunicorn", "DESC": "Gunicorn fails to properly validate Transfer-Encoding headers, leading to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) vulnerabilities. By crafting requests with conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, attackers can bypass security restrictions and access restricted endpoints. This issue is due to Gunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, where it incorrectly processes requests with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, treating them as chunked regardless of the final encoding specified. This vulnerability allows for a range of attacks including cache poisoning, session manipulation, and data exposure.", "PRODUIT": ""}
