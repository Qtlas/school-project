This causes\nnfs_file_open_context() to oops - however, we don't actually need the nfs\ncontext as we're only going to write to the cache.\n\nFix this by just returning if we aren't given a file pointer and emit a\nwarning if the request was for something other than copy-to-cache.\n\nFurther, fix nfs_netfs_free_request() so that it doesn't try to free the\ncontext if the pointer is NULL.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
