An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of an affected configuration CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.\r\nNote: To successfully exploit this vulnerability on a Cisco NX-OS device, an attacker must have Administrator credentials. The following Cisco devices already allow administrative users to access the underlying operating system through the bash-shell feature, so, for these devices, this vulnerability does not grant any additional privileges:\r\n\r\nNexus 3000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 7000 Series Switches that are running Cisco NX-OS Software releases 8.1(1) and later\r\nNexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
