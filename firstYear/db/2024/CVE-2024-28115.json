FreeRTOS Kernel versions through 10.6.1 do not sufficiently protect against local privilege escalation via Return Oriented Programming techniques should a vulnerability exist that allows code injection and execution. These issues affect ARMv7-M MPU ports, and ARMv8-M ports with Memory Protected Unit (MPU) support enabled (i.e. `configENABLE_MPU` set to 1). These issues are fixed in version 10.6.2 with a new MPU wrapper. ", "PRODUIT": "amazon"}
