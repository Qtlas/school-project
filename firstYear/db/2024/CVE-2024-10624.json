{"CVE": "CVE-2024-10624", "CWE": ["CWE-1333"], "DATE": "2025-03-20 10:15:17", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in gradio-app/gradio", "DESC": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, affecting the gr.Datetime component. The affected version is git commit 98cbcae. The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular expression `^(?:\\s*now\\s*(?:-\\s*(\\d+)\\s*([dmhs]))?)?\\s*$` to process user input. In Python's default regex engine, this regular expression can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request, causing the gradio process to consume 100% CPU and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the server.", "PRODUIT": "gradio_project"}
