To avoid\nacquiring unneeded locks, it first try to check if any unacked data\nis present at all in the RTX queue, but such check is currently\nbroken, as it uses TCP-specific helper on an MPTCP socket.\n\nFunnily enough fuzzers and static checkers are happy, as the accessed\nmemory still belongs to the mptcp_sock struct, and even from a\nfunctional perspective the recovery completed successfully, as\nthe short-cut test always failed.\n\nA recent unrelated TCP change - commit d5fed5addb2b (\"tcp: reorganize\ntcp_sock fast path variables\") - exposed the issue, as the tcp field\nreorganization makes the mptcp code always skip the re-inection.\n\nFix the issue dropping the bogus call: we are on a slow path, the early\noptimization proved once again to be evil.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
