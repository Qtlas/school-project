An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific page of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
