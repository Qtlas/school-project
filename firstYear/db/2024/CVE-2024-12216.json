The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a TarSlip vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victim's system via path traversal or faked symlinks.", "PRODUIT": ""}
