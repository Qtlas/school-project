Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to mark\nthe cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests to\navoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cached\ndata before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles.\n\nNote that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req,\notherwise it may UAF.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
