{"CVE": "CVE-2024-4326", "CWE": ["CWE-15"], "DATE": "2024-05-16 09:15:16", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Remote Code Execution via `/apply_settings` and `/execute_code` in parisneo/lollms-webui", "DESC": "A vulnerability in parisneo/lollms-webui versions up to 9.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of the `/apply_settings` and `/execute_code` endpoints. Attackers can bypass protections by setting the host to localhost, enabling code execution, and disabling code validation through the `/apply_settings` endpoint. Subsequently, arbitrary commands can be executed remotely via the `/execute_code` endpoint, exploiting the delay in settings enforcement. This issue was addressed in version 9.5.", "PRODUIT": "lollms"}
