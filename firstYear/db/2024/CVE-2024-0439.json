In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level.", "PRODUIT": ""}
