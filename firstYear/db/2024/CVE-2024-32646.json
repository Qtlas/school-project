{"CVE": "CVE-2024-32646", "CWE": ["CWE-20", "NVD-CWE-Other"], "DATE": "2024-04-25 18:15:08", "SCORE": 5.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "vyper performs double eval of the slice args when buffer from adhoc locations", "DESC": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `slice` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when the buffer argument is either `msg.data`, `self.code` or `<address>.code` and either the `start` or `length` arguments have side-effects. It can be easily triggered only with the versions `<0.3.4` as `0.3.4` introduced the unique symbol fence. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.\n\n", "PRODUIT": "vyperlang"}
