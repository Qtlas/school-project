Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject insert tags in frontend forms if the output is structured in a very specific way. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not output user data from frontend forms next to each other, always separate them by at least one character.", "PRODUIT": "contao"}
