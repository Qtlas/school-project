However the\nnext allocation from the same bitmap will notice the bitmap buffer is\nalready loaded and tries to allocate from the bitmap with mixed results\n(depending on the exact nature of the bitmap corruption). Fix the\nproblem by using BH_verified bit to indicate whether the bitmap is valid\nor not.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
