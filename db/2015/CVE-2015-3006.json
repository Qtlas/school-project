Entropy increases after the system has been up and running for some time, but immediately after boot, the entropy is very low. This issue only affects the QFX3500 and QFX3600 switches. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this weak entropy vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["juniper", "juniper$PRODUCT$junos", "juniper$PRODUCT$qfx3500", "juniper$PRODUCT$qfx3600"]}
