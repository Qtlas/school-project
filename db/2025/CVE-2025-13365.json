This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'hallo_welt_seite' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Due to the insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, this can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.", "VENDOR": []}
