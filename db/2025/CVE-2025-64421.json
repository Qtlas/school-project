{"CVE": "CVE-2025-64421", "CWE": ["CWE-863"], "DATE": "2026-01-05T20:16:02.860000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Coolify has a privilege escalation - low privileged user can invite themselves as an admin user", "DESC": "Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. In Coolify versions up to and including v4.0.0-beta.434, a low privileged user (member) can invite a high privileged user. At first, the application will throw an error, but if the attacker clicks the invite button a second time, it actually works. This way, a low privileged user can invite themselves as an administrator to the Coolify instance. After the high privileged user is invited, the attacker can initiate a password reset and log in with the new admin. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch is available.", "VENDOR": []}
