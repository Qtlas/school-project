When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a\ndevice in the backlight class which has name \"appletb_backlight\" and\nupon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device\nand returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released\nleading to a reference leak.\n\nFix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal\nvia put_device and on probe failure.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
