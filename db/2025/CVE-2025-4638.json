This issue may allow context-dependent attackers to cause undefined behavior by exploiting improper pointer arithmetic.\n\nSince version 1.14.0, PCL by default uses a zlib installation from the system, unless the user sets WITH_SYSTEM_ZLIB=FALSE. So this potential vulnerability is only relevant if the PCL version is older than 1.14.0 or the user specifically requests to not use the system zlib.", "PRODUIT": ["pointclouds", "pointclouds$PRODUCT$point_cloud_library"]}
