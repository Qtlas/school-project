Because jiffies are never updated, as we are in a context with\ninterrupts disabled, we never exit that loop and have a deadlock.\n\nThat deadlock was noticed on a sama5d4 device that stayed locked for days.\n\nUse retries instead of jiffies so that the timeout really works and we do\nnot have a deadlock anymore.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
