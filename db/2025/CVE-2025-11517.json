This is due to the /wp-json/tribe/tickets/v1/commerce/free/order endpoint not verifying that a ticket type should be free allowing the user to bypass the payment. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain access to paid tickets, without paying for them, causing a loss of revenue for the target.", "VENDOR": []}
