This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting WXR files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid WXR file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "PRODUIT": ""}
