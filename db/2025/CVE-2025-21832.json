The\nlatter can lead to attempting to revert with a negative value, which\nwhen passed to iov_iter_revert() as an unsigned value will lead to\nthrowing a WARN_ON() because unroll is bigger than MAX_RW_COUNT.\n\nBe sane and don't revert for -EIOCBQUEUED, like what is done in other\nspots.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
