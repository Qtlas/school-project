An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly sending crafted DHCPv4 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available memory, which would affect availability of services and prevent new processes from starting, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition that would require a manual reboot.\r\nNote: On Cisco Secure FTD Software, this vulnerability does not affect management interfaces.", "VENDOR": []}
