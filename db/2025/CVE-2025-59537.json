With the default configuration, no webhook.gogs.secret set, Argo CD\u2019s /api/webhook endpoint will crash the entire argocd-server process when it receives a Gogs push event whose JSON field commits[].repo is not set or is null. This issue is fixed in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19.", "VENDOR": ["argoproj", "argoproj$PRODUCT$argo_cd"]}
