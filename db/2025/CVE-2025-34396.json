The MailEnable administrative executable attempts to load MEAINFY.DLL from its application directo without sufficient integrity validation or secure search order. If the DLL is missing or attacker-writable locations in the search path are used, a local attacker with write permissions to the directory can plant a malicious MEAINFY.DLL. When the executable is launched, it loads the attacker-controlled library and executes code with the privileges of the process, enabling local privilege escalation when run with elevated rights.", "PRODUIT": ["mailenable", "mailenable$PRODUCT$mailenable"]}
