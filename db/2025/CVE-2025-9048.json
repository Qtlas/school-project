{"CVE": "CVE-2025-9048", "CWE": ["CWE-73"], "DATE": "2025-08-23T05:15:33", "CVSS": 8.1, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Wptobe-memberships <= 3.4.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion", "DESC": "The Wptobe-memberships plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the del_img_ajax_call() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "VENDOR": []}
