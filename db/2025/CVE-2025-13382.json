This is due to the plugin not validating file ownership before processing file rename requests in the '/wpfm/v1/file-rename' REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to rename files uploaded by other users via the 'fileid' parameter.", "PRODUIT": ""}
