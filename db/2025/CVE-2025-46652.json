When a user performs an extraction from an archive file that bears Mark-of-the-Web, Mark-of-the-Web is not propagated to the extracted files. NOTE: this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file's content.", "VENDOR": []}
