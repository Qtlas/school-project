These binaries are built as 32-bit, without Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Control Flow Guard (CFG), or stack-protection, and they incorporate legacy technologies (Pascal/Delphi and Python 2) which are no longer commonly maintained. Several of these processes run with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM for PrinterInstallerClient.exe and PrinterInstallerClientLauncher.exe), and the client automatically downloads and installs printer drivers. The absence of modern memory safety mitigations and the use of unmaintained runtimes substantially increase the risk that memory-corruption or other exploit primitives \u2014 for example from crafted driver content or maliciously crafted inputs \u2014 can be turned into remote or local code execution and privilege escalation to SYSTEM.\u00a0This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.", "PRODUIT": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "vasion", "vasion$PRODUCT$virtual_appliance_application", "vasion$PRODUCT$virtual_appliance_host"]}
