{"CVE": "CVE-2025-61914", "CWE": ["CWE-79"], "DATE": "2025-12-26 22:15:51", "SCORE": 7.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "TITLE": "n8n's Possible Stored XSS in \"Respond to Webhook\" Node May Execute Outside iframe Sandbox", "DESC": "n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.114.0, a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability may occur in n8n when using the \u201cRespond to Webhook\u201d node. When this node responds with HTML content containing executable scripts, the payload may execute directly in the top-level window, rather than within the expected sandbox introduced in version 1.103.0. This behavior can enable a malicious actor with workflow creation permissions to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the n8n editor interface. This issue has been patched in version 1.114.0. Workarounds for this issue involve restricting workflow creation and modification privileges to trusted users only, avoiding use of untrusted HTML responses in the \u201cRespond to Webhook\u201d node, and using an external reverse proxy or HTML sanitizer to filter responses that include executable scripts.", "PRODUIT": "n8n"}
