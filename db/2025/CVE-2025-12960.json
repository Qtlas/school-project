This is due to insufficient path validation before concatenating user-supplied input to a base directory path. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information such as database credentials and authentication keys.", "PRODUIT": ""}
