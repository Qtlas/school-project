Then file_priv_unbind() triggers a warning in\ndrm_mm_takedown() during context teardown.\n\nProtect the unmapping sequence with bo_list_lock to ensure the BO is\nalways fully unmapped when removed from the list. This ensures the BO\nis either fully unmapped at context teardown time or present on the\nlist and unmapped by file_priv_unbind().", "VENDOR": []}
