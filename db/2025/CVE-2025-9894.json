This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the crsf_cron_job_func function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger content synchronization from Feedly, potentially creating multiple posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
