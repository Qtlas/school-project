When a victim clicks on this link, the script executes within the victim's browser, redirecting them to a site controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to access and/or modify restricted information related to the web client. While the vulnerability poses no impact on data availability, it presents a considerable risk to confidentiality and integrity.", "VENDOR": []}
