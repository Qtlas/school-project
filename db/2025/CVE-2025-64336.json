In versions 5.5.2-#146 and below, the Manage Photos feature is vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). An authenticated regular user can upload a photo with a malicious Photo Title containing HTML/JavaScript code. While the payload does not execute in the user-facing photo gallery or detail pages, it is rendered unsafely in the Admin \u2192 Manage Photos section, resulting in JavaScript execution in the administrator\u2019s browser. This issue is fixed in version 5.5.2-#147.", "PRODUIT": ["oxygenz", "oxygenz$PRODUCT$clipbucket"]}
