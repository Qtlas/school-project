The sample code for the EKS environment provisioning role is configured to trust the account root principal, which may enable any IAM principal in the same AWS account with sts:AssumeRole permissions to assume the role with administrative privileges.\n\n\nWe recommend customers upgrade to Harmonix on AWS v0.4.2 or later if you have deployed the framework using versions v0.3.0 through v0.4.1.", "VENDOR": []}
