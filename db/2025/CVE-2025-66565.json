In versions 2.0.0-rc.3 and below, when the system's cryptographic random number generator (crypto/rand) fails, both functions silently fall back to returning predictable UUID values, including the zero UUID \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\". The vulnerability occurs through two related but distinct failure paths, both ultimately caused by crypto/rand.Read() failures, compromising the security of all Fiber applications using these functions for security-critical operations. This issue is fixed in version 2.0.0-rc.4.", "VENDOR": ["gofiber", "gofiber$PRODUCT$utils"]}
