This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check\nsch->limit against sch->q.qlen.\n\nThis patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensures\nboth the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming\nexcess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie)\nare updated to use this helper in their ->change() routines.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
