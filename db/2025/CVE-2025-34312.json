When a blacklist is installed the application issues an HTTP POST to /cgi-bin/urlfilter.cgi and interpolates the value of BE_NAME directly into a shell invocation without appropriate sanitation. Crafted input can inject shell metacharacters, leading to arbitrary command execution in the context of the 'nobody' user.", "VENDOR": ["ipfire", "ipfire$PRODUCT$ipfire"]}
