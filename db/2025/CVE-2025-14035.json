This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a page with the debate shortcode. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "VENDOR": []}
