Although UUIDv4 conversation IDs are generated server-side and are difficult to brute force, they can be obtained from less-protected sources such as server-side access logs, browser history, or screenshots. The vulnerability permits a logged-in user to gain read-only access to another user's conversations by exploiting the `/api/share/conversationID` endpoint, which lacks authorization checks. This issue is resolved in version v0.7.9-rc1.", "VENDOR": ["librechat", "librechat$PRODUCT$librechat"]}
