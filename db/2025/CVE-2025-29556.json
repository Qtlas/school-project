Since version 6.3, ExaGrid enforces restrictions preventing users with the Admin role from creating or modifying users with the Security Officer role without approval. However, a flaw in the account creation process allows an attacker to bypass these restrictions via API request manipulation. An attacker with an Admin access can intercept and modify the API request during user creation, altering the parameters to assign the new account to the ExaGrid Security Officers group without the required approval.", "VENDOR": []}
