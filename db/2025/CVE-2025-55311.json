This circumvents digital signature verification by hiding document modifications, allowing an attacker to mislead users about the document's integrity and compromise the trustworthiness of signed PDFs.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "foxit", "foxit$PRODUCT$pdf_editor", "foxit$PRODUCT$pdf_reader", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows"]}
