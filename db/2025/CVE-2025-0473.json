This vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality on the \u2018/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities\u2019 endpoint. When a file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted after the client sends a POST request to \u2018/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities\u2019. This workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted.", "VENDOR": ["sigb", "sigb$PRODUCT$pmb"]}
