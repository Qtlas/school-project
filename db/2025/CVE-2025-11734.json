This is due to the plugin registering a REST API endpoint that only checks for a broad capability (aioseo_blc_broken_links_page) that is granted to contributor level users, without verifying the user's permission to perform actions on the specific post being targeted. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to trash arbitrary posts via the DELETE /wp-json/aioseoBrokenLinkChecker/v1/post endpoint.", "VENDOR": []}
