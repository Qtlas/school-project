If user unloads hns3 driver at\nthe time, because it removes all the ae_dev nodes, and it may cause\noops.\n\nBut we can't simply use hnae3_common_lock for this. Because in the\nprocess flow of pci_disable_sriov(), it will trigger the remove flow\nof VF, which will also take hnae3_common_lock.\n\nTo fixes it, introduce a new mutex to protect the unload process.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
