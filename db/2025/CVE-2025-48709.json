An authenticated attacker with shell access could observe these credentials and use them to log in to the database server. For example, when Control-M/Server on Windows has a database connection on, it runs 'DBUStatus.exe' frequently, which then calls 'dbu_connection_details.vbs' with the username, password, database hostname, and port written in cleartext, which can be seen in event and process logs in two separate locations. Fixed in PACTV.9.0.21.307.", "PRODUIT": ["bmc", "bmc$PRODUCT$control-m\\/server"]}
