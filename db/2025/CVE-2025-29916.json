Datasets declared in rules have an option to specify the `hashsize` to use. This size setting isn't properly limited, so the hash table allocation can be large. Untrusted rules can lead to large memory allocations, potentially leading to denial of service due to resource starvation. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.9.", "PRODUIT": "oisf"}
