Prior to version 25.11.0, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the LibreNMS application at the /maps/nodeimage endpoint. The Image Name parameter is reflected in the HTTP response without proper output encoding or sanitization, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that, when visited by a victim, causes arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim\u2019s browser. This issue has been patched in version 25.11.0.", "PRODUIT": ["librenms", "librenms$PRODUCT$librenms"]}
