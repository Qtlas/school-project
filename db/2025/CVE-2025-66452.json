In versions 0.8.0 and below, there is no handler for JSON parsing errors; SyntaxError from express.json() includes user input in the error message, which gets reflected in responses. User input (including HTML/JavaScript) can be exposed in error responses, creating an XSS risk if Content-Type isn't strictly enforced. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication.", "PRODUIT": ["librechat", "librechat$PRODUCT$librechat"]}
