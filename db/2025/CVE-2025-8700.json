Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.\n\nAccording to Apple documentation, when a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement, the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator's credentials. Since there is no prompt when the target process has \"get-task-allow\" entitlement, the presence of this entitlement was decided to be treated as a vulnerability because it removes one step needed to perform an attack.\n\n\nThis issue was fixed in version 5.0.175", "VENDOR": []}
