This is a configuration vulnerability affecting nginx-defender deployments. Example configuration files\nconfig.yaml and docker-compose.yml contain default credentials (default_password: \"change_me_please\", GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123). If users deploy nginx-defender without changing these defaults, attackers with network access could gain administrative control, bypassing security protections. The issue is addressed in v1.5.0 and later.", "VENDOR": []}
