{"CVE": "CVE-2025-67719", "CWE": ["CWE-620"], "DATE": "2025-12-11T02:16:18.097000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Ibexa User Bundle is missing password change validation", "DESC": "Ibexa is a composable end-to-end DXP (Digital Experience Platform). Versions 5.0.0-beta1 through 5.0.3 do not have password validation. During the transition from v4 to v5 an error was introduced into validation code which causes the validation of the previous password not to run as expected. This makes it possible for a logged in user to change their password in the back office without knowing the previous password. For example, if a user logs into their account and walks away without locking their workstation, an attacker could access the unattended session and change the password, therefore locking the legitimate user out. This issue is fixed in version 5.0.4.", "VENDOR": []}
