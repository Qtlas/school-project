This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 3.9.29.", "PRODUIT": "vjinfotech"}
