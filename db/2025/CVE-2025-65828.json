These commands include: shutdown, restart, clear config. Clear config would disassociate the current device from its user and would require re-configuration to re-enable the device. As a result, the end user would be unable to receive updates from the Meatmeet base station which communicates with the cloud services until the device had been fixed or turned back on.", "VENDOR": ["meatmeet", "meatmeet$PRODUCT$meatmeet_pro_wifi_\\&_bluetooth_meat_thermometer", "meatmeet$PRODUCT$meatmeet_pro_wifi_\\&_bluetooth_meat_thermometer_firmware"]}
