In some commits on version 1.2, a vulnerability was identified where user data, including email addresses and Discord usernames, were exposed in API responses without proper access controls. This allowed unauthorized users to access sensitive user information by directly calling specific endpoints. This issue has been patched in a later commit on version 1.2.", "VENDOR": []}
