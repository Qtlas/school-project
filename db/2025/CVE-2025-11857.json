This is due to the plugin not properly sanitizing user input and output of the 'post_id' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "PRODUIT": ""}
