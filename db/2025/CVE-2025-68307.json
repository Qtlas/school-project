This reduces the\nnumber of available URBs per error by 1. This leads to reduced performance\nand ultimately to a complete stop of the transmission.\n\nIf the sending of a bulk URB fails do proper cleanup:\n- increase netdev stats\n- mark the echo_sbk as free\n- free the driver's context and do accounting\n- wake the send queue", "VENDOR": []}
