The vulnerability arises due to inappropriate secure coding measures, specifically the lack of proper implementation of the max_depth parameter in the get_article_urls function. This allows an attacker to exhaust Python's recursion limit through repeated function calls, leading to resource consumption and ultimately crashing the Python process.", "VENDOR": ["llamaindex", "llamaindex$PRODUCT$llamaindex"]}
