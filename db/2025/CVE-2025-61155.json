A user-mode process can open a handle to the driver device and send specially crafted IOCTL requests. These requests are executed in kernel-mode context without proper authentication or access validation, allowing the attacker to terminate arbitrary processes, including critical system and security services, without requiring administrative privileges.", "VENDOR": []}
