Otherwise, the folio will not be freed, causing memory\nleak.\n\nThis leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a\ntruncate is performed, where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order\nones, causing truncated folios not being freed.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
