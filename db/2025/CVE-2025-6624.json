Container Registry credentials provided via environment variables or command line arguments can be exposed when executing Snyk CLI in DEBUG or DEBUG/TRACE mode.\r\rThe issue affects the following Snyk commands:\r\r1. When snyk container test or snyk container monitor commands are run against a container registry, with debug mode enabled, the container registry credentials may be written into the local Snyk CLI debug log. This only happens with credentials specified in environment variables (SNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME and SNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD), or in the CLI (--password/-p and  --username/-u).\r\r2. When snyk auth command is executed with debug mode enabled AND the log level is set to TRACE, the Snyk access / refresh credential tokens used to connect the CLI to Snyk may be written into the local CLI debug logs.\r\r3. When snyk iac test is executed with a Remote IAC Custom rules bundle, debug mode enabled, AND the log level is set to TRACE, the docker registry token may be written into the local CLI debug logs.", "VENDOR": ["snyk", "snyk$PRODUCT$snyk_cli"]}
