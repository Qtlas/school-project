This allowed attackers to craft requests that could be misinterpreted by backend servers. The issue was fixed by disallowing stray data after a chunk, and is no longer exploitable. No action is required as Classic Application Load Balancer service after 2025-04-26 is not vulnerable.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$application_load_balancer"]}
