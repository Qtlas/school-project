This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the \"bplde_save_document_library\", \"bplde_get_all\", \"bplde_get_single\", and \"bplde_delete_document_library\" functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, read, update, and delete arbitrary document_library posts.", "VENDOR": []}
