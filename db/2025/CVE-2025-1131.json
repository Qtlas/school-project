When Asterisk is started via this script (common in SysV init or FreePBX environments), it sources all .sh files located in /etc/asterisk/startup.d/ as root, without validating ownership or permissions.\n\n\nNon-root users with legitimate write access to /etc/asterisk can exploit this behaviour by placing malicious scripts in the startup.d directory, which will then execute with root privileges upon service restart.", "PRODUIT": ["sangoma", "sangoma$PRODUCT$asterisk", "sangoma$PRODUCT$certified_asterisk"]}
