The applications fail to validate the OAuth state parameter during the account linking flow, enabling a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)-like attack. By tricking the victim into clicking a crafted authorization link, an attacker can complete the OAuth flow on the victim's behalf, resulting in unauthorized Alexa access to the victim's Tuya-connected devices. This affects users regardless of prior Alexa linkage and does not require the Tuya application to be active at the time. Successful exploitation may allow remote control of devices such as cameras, doorbells, door locks, or alarms.", "VENDOR": ["tuya", "tuya$PRODUCT$smartlife", "tuya$PRODUCT$tuya", "tuya$PRODUCT$tuya_smart"]}
