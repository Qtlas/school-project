This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Additionally, the result of this SQL injection is passed directly to PHP's unlink() function, allowing attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server by injecting file paths through the SQL query.", "VENDOR": []}
