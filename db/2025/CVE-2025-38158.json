Therefore, the address combination\nsequence needs to be corrected.\n\nEven after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue\nwhere the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to\nnew kernel and may result in wrong data.\n\nIn order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,\nif an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be\nupdated.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
