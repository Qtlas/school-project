In versions 0.5.6 and below, youki\u2019s apparmor handling performs insufficiently strict write-target validation, and when combined with path substitution during pathname resolution, can allow writes to unintended procfs locations. While resolving a path component-by-component, a shared-mount race can substitute intermediate components and redirect the final target. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.7.", "VENDOR": ["youki-dev", "youki-dev$PRODUCT$youki"]}
