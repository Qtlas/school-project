The plugin\u2019s permission callback only verifies that the supplied, encrypted attachment ID maps to an existing attachment post, but does not verify the requester\u2019s identity or capabilities. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as an arbitrary user.", "VENDOR": []}
