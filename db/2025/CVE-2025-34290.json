{"CVE": "CVE-2025-34290", "CWE": ["CWE-250", "CWE-367"], "DATE": "2025-12-20T20:15:50", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Versa SASE Client for Windows < 7.9.5 Arbitrary Folder Deletion Leading to Local Privilege Escalation", "DESC": "Versa SASE Client for Windows versions released between 7.8.7 and 7.9.4 contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the audit log export functionality. The client communicates user-controlled file paths to a privileged service, which performs file system operations without impersonating the requesting user. Due to improper privilege handling and a time-of-check time-of-use race condition combined with symbolic link and mount point manipulation, a local authenticated attacker can coerce the service into deleting arbitrary directories with SYSTEM privileges. This can be exploited to delete protected system folders such as C:\\\\Config.msi and subsequently achieve execution as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM via MSI rollback techniques.", "VENDOR": []}
