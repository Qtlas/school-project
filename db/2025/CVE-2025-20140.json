An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of IPv6 network requests from an associated wireless IPv6 client to an affected device. To associate a client to a device, an attacker may first need to authenticate to the network, or associate freely in the case of a configured open network. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wncd process to consume available memory and eventually cause the device to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axp", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl_wireless_controllers_for_cloud", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_cw9800h1", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_cw9800h2", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_cw9800m", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
