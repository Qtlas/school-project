Prior to version 5.3.2, a string passed to devalue.parse could represent an object with a __proto__ property and devalue.parse does not check that an index is numeric. This could result in assigning prototypes to objects and properties, leading to prototype pollution. This issue has been fixed in version 5.3.2", "VENDOR": []}
