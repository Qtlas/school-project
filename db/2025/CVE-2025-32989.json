This flaw allows a malicious user to create a certificate containing a malformed SCT extension (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.2) that contains sensitive data. This issue leads to the exposure of confidential information when GnuTLS verifies certificates from certain websites when the certificate (SCT) is not checked correctly.", "PRODUIT": ["gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$gnutls", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform"]}
