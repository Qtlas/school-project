Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was identified in the \"Languages\" submenu of the Grav admin configuration panel (/admin/config/system). Specifically, the Supported parameter fails to properly validate user input. If a malformed value is inserted\u2014such as a single forward slash (/) or an XSS test string\u2014it causes a fatal regular expression parsing error on the server. This leads to application-wide failure due to the use of the preg_match() function with an improperly constructed regular expression, resulting in an error. Once triggered, the site becomes completely unavailable to all users. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27.", "PRODUIT": "getgrav"}
