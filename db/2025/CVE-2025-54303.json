The user guide recommends changing default credentials; however, a password change policy for default administrative accounts is not enforced. Many deployments may retain default credentials, in which case an attacker is likely to be able to successfully authenticate with administrative privileges.", "VENDOR": ["thermofisher", "thermofisher$PRODUCT$torrent_suite_software"]}
