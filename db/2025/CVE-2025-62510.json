In version 1.4.0, a regression allowed folder visibility/ownership to be inferred from folder names. Low-privilege users could see or interact with folders matching their username and, in some cases, other users\u2019 content. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.0, where it introduces explicit per-folder ACLs (owners/read/write/share/read_own) and strict server-side checks across list, read, write, share, rename, copy/move, zip, and WebDAV paths.", "VENDOR": ["filerise", "filerise$PRODUCT$filerise"]}
