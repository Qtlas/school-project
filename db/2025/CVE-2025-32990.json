When it reads certain settings from a template file, it allows an attacker to cause an out-of-bounds (OOB) NULL pointer write, resulting in memory corruption and a denial-of-service (DoS) that could potentially crash the system.", "VENDOR": ["gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$gnutls", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform"]}
