An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious files on the affected system and then execute arbitrary code or obtain root privileges on the system.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$identity_services_engine", "cisco$PRODUCT$identity_services_engine_passive_identity_connector"]}
