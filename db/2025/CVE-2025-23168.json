{"CVE": "CVE-2025-23168", "CWE": ["CWE-290"], "DATE": "2025-06-19T00:15:21.377000+00:00", "CVSS": 6.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "TITLE": null, "DESC": "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform implements Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using One-Time Passcodes (OTP) delivered via email or SMS. Versa Director accepts untrusted user input when dispatching 2FA codes, allowing an attacker who knows a valid username and password to redirect the OTP delivery (SMS/email) to their own device. OTP/TOTP codes are not invalidated after use, enabling reuse by an attacker who has previously intercepted or obtained a valid code. In addition, the 2FA system does not adequately restrict the number or frequency of login attempts. The OTP values are generated from a relatively small keyspace, making brute-force attacks more feasible. \r\n\r\nExploitation Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nVersa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.", "VENDOR": ["versa-networks", "versa-networks$PRODUCT$versa_director"]}
