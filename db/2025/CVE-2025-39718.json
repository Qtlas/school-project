Unfortunately,\nvirtio_vsock_skb_rx_put() uses the length from the packet header as the\nlength argument to skb_put(), potentially resulting in SKB overflow if\nthe host has gone wonky.\n\nValidate the length as advertised by the packet header before calling\nvirtio_vsock_skb_rx_put().", "VENDOR": []}
