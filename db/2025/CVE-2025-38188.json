Otherwise a\nuserspace submission in one context could cause another context to\nfunction incorrectly and hang, effectively a denial of service (although\nwithout leaking data). This was missed during initial a7xx bringup.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/654924/", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
