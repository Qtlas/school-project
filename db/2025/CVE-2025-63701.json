The driver incorrectly assumes the output buffer size matches the input buffer size, leading to invalid memory operations and heap corruption. This vulnerability can cause denial of service through application crashes and potentially lead to code execution in user space. Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": []}
