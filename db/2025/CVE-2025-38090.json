The\nresult is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdr\nwhich were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send()\nallocated.\n\nAddress this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entire\nrio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
