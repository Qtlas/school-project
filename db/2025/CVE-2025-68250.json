This breaks the\nassumption and causes two related WARN_ON_ONCE checks to trigger.\n\nTo fix this, the runtime checks are adjusted to silently ignore any lock\nthat is not 4-byte aligned, effectively disabling the feature in such\ncases and avoiding the related warnings.\n\nThanks to Geert Uytterhoeven for bisecting!", "VENDOR": []}
