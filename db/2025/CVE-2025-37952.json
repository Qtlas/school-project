The existing checks on fp->refcount are not sufficient to\nprevent this.\n\nThe fix takes ft->lock around the section which removes the\nfile from the file table. This prevents two threads acquiring the\nsame file pointer via __close_file_table_ids, as well as the other\nfunctions which retrieve a file from the IDR and which already use\nthis same lock.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
