This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The arbitrary file upload was sufficiently patched in 11.4.5, but a capability check was added in 11.4.6 to properly prevent unauthorized limited file uploads.", "VENDOR": ["greenshiftwp", "greenshiftwp$PRODUCT$greenshift_-_animation_and_page_builder_blocks"]}
