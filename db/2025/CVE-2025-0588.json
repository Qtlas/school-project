By submitting a specifically crafted referrer header the user could ensure that all subsequent server responses would return 500 errors rendering the site mostly unusable. The user would be able to subsequently set and unset the referrer header to control the denial of service state with a valid CSRF token whilst new CSRF tokens could not be generated.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "octopus", "octopus$PRODUCT$octopus_server"]}
