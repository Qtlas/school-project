This interface, referred to as the \"ATEM Ethernet Protocol 1.0\", provides complete device control without requiring credentials or encryption. An attacker on the same network (or with remote access to the exposed port) can exploit this interface to execute arbitrary streaming commands, erase disks, or shut down the device - effectively gaining full remote control.", "VENDOR": []}
