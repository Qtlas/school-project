This is due to the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/aioseo/v1/ai/image-generator` only verifying that users have the `edit_posts` capability (Contributors and above) without checking if they own or have permission to delete the specific media attachments. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to permanently delete arbitrary media attachments by ID via the REST API, granted they can determine valid attachment IDs.", "VENDOR": []}
