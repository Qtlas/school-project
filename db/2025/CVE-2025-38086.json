However \"buff\" is conditionally\ninitialised inside control_read():\n\n        if (err == size) {\n                memcpy(data, buf, size);\n        }\n\nIf the condition of \"err == size\" is not met, then\n\"buff\" remains uninitialised. Once this happens the\nuninitialised \"buff\" is accessed and returned during\nch9200_mdio_read():\n\n        return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);\n\nThe problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()\nignores the return value of control_read(), leading to\nuinit-access of \"buff\".\n\nTo fix this we should check the return value of\ncontrol_read() and return early on error.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
