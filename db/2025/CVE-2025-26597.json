If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with a 0 group, it will resize the key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged. If the same function is later called with a non-zero value of groups, this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong size.", "PRODUIT": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "tigervnc", "tigervnc$PRODUCT$tigervnc", "x.org", "x.org$PRODUCT$x_server", "x.org$PRODUCT$xwayland"]}
