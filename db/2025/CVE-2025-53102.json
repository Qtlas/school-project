Prior to version 3.4.7 on the `stable` branch and version 3.5.0.beta.8 on the `tests-passed` branch, upon issuing a physical security key for 2FA, the server generates a WebAuthn challenge, which the client signs. The challenge is not cleared from the user\u2019s session after authentication, potentially allowing reuse and increasing security risk. This is fixed in versions 3.4.7 and 3.5.0.beta.8.", "PRODUIT": ""}
