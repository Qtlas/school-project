An attacker-defined callback could run during js_print_value, during which the array could get resized and len1\u00a0become out of bounds. This results in a use-after-free.A second instance occurs in the same function during printing of a map or set objects. The code iterates over ms->records\u00a0list, but once again, elements could be removed from the list during js_print_value\u00a0call.", "VENDOR": ["quickjs_project", "quickjs_project$PRODUCT$quickjs"]}
