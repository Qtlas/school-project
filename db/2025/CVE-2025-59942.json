In versions 0.8.6 and below, go-f3 panics when it validates a \"poison\" messages causing Filecoin nodes consuming F3 messages to become vulnerable. A \"poison\" message can can cause integer overflow in the signer index validation, which can cause the whole node to crash. These malicious messages aren't self-propagating since the bug is in the validator. An attacker needs to directly send the message to all targets. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.7.", "VENDOR": ["filecoin", "filecoin$PRODUCT$go-f3"]}
