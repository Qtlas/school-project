{"CVE": "CVE-2025-40820", "CWE": ["CWE-940"], "DATE": "2025-12-09T16:17:46", "CVSS": 7.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "TITLE": null, "DESC": "Affected products do not properly enforce TCP sequence number validation in specific scenarios but accept values within a broad range. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker e.g. to interfere with connection setup, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attack succeeds only if an attacker can inject IP packets with spoofed addresses at precisely timed moments, and it affects only TCP-based services.", "VENDOR": []}
