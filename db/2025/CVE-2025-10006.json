This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when RevSlider is also installed.", "VENDOR": ["wpbakery", "wpbakery$PRODUCT$page_builder"]}
