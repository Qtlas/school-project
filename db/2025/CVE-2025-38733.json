If the option is specified the lowcore is mapped\ntwice, instead of only once.\n\nThis means that NULL pointer accesses will succeed instead of causing an\nexception (low address protection still applies, but covers only parts).\nTo fix this never map the first two pages of physical memory with the\nidentity mapping.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
