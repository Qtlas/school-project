Prior to commit dea1e16, a malicious package can introduce arbitrary JavaScript code into the Hydra database that is automatically evaluated in a client's browser when anyone visits the build page. This could be done by a third-party project as part of its build process. This also happens in other places like with hydra-release-name. This issue has been patched by commit dea1e16. A workaround involves either not building untrusted packages or not visiting the builds page.", "VENDOR": ["nixos", "nixos$PRODUCT$hydra"]}
