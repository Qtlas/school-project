This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial EV chargers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of USB frame packets. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26328.", "PRODUIT": "autel"}
