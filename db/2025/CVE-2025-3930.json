{"CVE": "CVE-2025-3930", "CWE": ["CWE-613"], "DATE": "2025-10-16 11:15:29", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Lack of JWT Expiration after Log Out in Strapi", "DESC": "Strapi uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. After logout or account deactivation, the JWT is not invalidated, which allows an attacker who has stolen or intercepted the token to freely reuse it until its expiration date (which is set to 30 days by default, but can be changed). \nThe existence of /admin/renew-token\u00a0endpoint allows anyone to renew near-expiration tokens indefinitely, further increasing the impact of this attack. \n\nThis issue has been fixed in version 5.24.1.", "PRODUIT": ""}
