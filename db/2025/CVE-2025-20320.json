The vulnerability requires the low-privileged user to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The low-privileged user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.", "VENDOR": ["splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$splunk_cloud_platform"]}
