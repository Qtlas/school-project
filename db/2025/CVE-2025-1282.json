This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). The add_car() function may also make it possible to read arbitrary files.", "VENDOR": ["thememakers", "thememakers$PRODUCT$car_dealer_automotive"]}
