Prior to 2.1.0, the access control mechanism for the Proxy feature uses simple string comparisons and is therefore vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker may try to guess the password one character at a time by sending all possible characters to a vulnerable mechanism and measuring the comparison instruction\u2019s execution times. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.", "VENDOR": ["linuxfoundation", "linuxfoundation$PRODUCT$dragonfly"]}
