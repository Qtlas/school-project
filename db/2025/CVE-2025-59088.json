This creates a server-side request forgery vulnerability, since an attacker could send a request for a realm matching a DNS zone where they created SRV records pointing to arbitrary ports and hostnames (which may resolve to loopback or internal IP addresses). This vulnerability can be exploited to probe internal network topology and firewall rules, perform port scanning, and exfiltrate data. Deployments where\nthe \"use_dns\" setting is explicitly set to false are not affected.", "VENDOR": []}
