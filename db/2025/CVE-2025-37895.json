But in the bnxt_open() path,\nBNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED is not set and this causes the error\npath to think that it needs to cancel the uninitalized dim work.\nFix it by setting BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED during initialization.\nThe bit will be cleared when we enable NAPI and initialize dim work.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
