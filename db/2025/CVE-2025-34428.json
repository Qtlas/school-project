The product stores user and administrative passwords in plaintext within AUTH.SAV with overly permissive filesystem access. A local authenticated user with read access to this file can recover all user passwords and super-admin credentials, then use them to authenticate to MailEnable services such as POP3, SMTP, or the webmail interface, enabling unauthorized mailbox access and administrative control.", "VENDOR": ["mailenable", "mailenable$PRODUCT$mailenable"]}
