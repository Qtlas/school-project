In 2.8.0 and earlier, the code checks if the userRole is \"admin\" only when visiting the /admin page, but not when visiting its subroutes. Specifically, only the file routes/adminPanel.py checks the user role when a user is trying to access the admin page, but that control is not done for the pages routes/adminPanelComments.py and routes/adminPanelPosts.py. Thus, an unauthorized user can bypass the intended restrictions, leaking sensitive data and accessing the following pages: /admin/posts, /adminpanel/posts, /admin/comments, and /adminpanel/comments.", "VENDOR": ["dogukanurker", "dogukanurker$PRODUCT$flaskblog"]}
