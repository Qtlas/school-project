{"CVE": "CVE-2025-34452", "CWE": ["CWE-22", "CWE-918"], "DATE": "2025-12-18T22:15:56", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Streama Subtitle Download Path Traversal and SSRF Leading to Arbitrary File Write", "DESC": "Streama versions 1.10.0 through 1.10.5 and prior to commit b7c8767 contain a\u00a0combination of path traversal and server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities in that allow an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files to the server filesystem. The issue exists in the subtitle download functionality, where user-controlled parameters are used to fetch remote content and construct file paths without proper validation. By supplying a crafted subtitle download URL and a path traversal sequence in the file name, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.", "VENDOR": []}
