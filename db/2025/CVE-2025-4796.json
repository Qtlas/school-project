{"CVE": "CVE-2025-4796", "CWE": ["CWE-639"], "DATE": "2025-08-08T19:15:36", "CVSS": 8.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Eventin <= 4.0.34 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Privilege Escalation via User Email Change/Account Takeover", "DESC": "The Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.34. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity or capability prior to updating their details like email in the 'Eventin\\Speaker\\Api\\SpeakerController::update_item' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "VENDOR": ["themewinter", "themewinter$PRODUCT$eventin"]}
