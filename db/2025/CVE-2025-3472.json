This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes when WooCommerce is also installed and activated.", "VENDOR": ["oceanwp", "oceanwp$PRODUCT$ocean_extra"]}
