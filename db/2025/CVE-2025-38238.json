On send completion, this causes an attempt to\nfree the same frame twice that leads to a crash.\n\nFix crash by allocating separate frames for RHBA and RPA, and modify ABTS\nlogic accordingly.\n\nTested by checking MDS for FDMI information.\n\nTested by using instrumented driver to:\n\n - Drop PLOGI response\n - Drop RHBA response\n - Drop RPA response\n - Drop RHBA and RPA response\n - Drop PLOGI response + ABTS response\n - Drop RHBA response + ABTS response\n - Drop RPA response + ABTS response\n - Drop RHBA and RPA response + ABTS response for both of them", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
