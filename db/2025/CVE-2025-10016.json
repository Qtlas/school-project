{"CVE": "CVE-2025-10016", "CWE": ["CWE-863"], "DATE": "2025-09-16 10:15:38", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Local Privilege Escalation in Sparkle Autoupdate Daemon", "DESC": "The Sparkle framework includes a helper tool Autoupdate. Due to lack of authentication of connecting clients a local unprivileged attacker  can request installation of crafted malicious PKG file\u00a0by racing to connect to the daemon when other app spawns it as root. This results in local privilege escalation to root privileges. It is worth noting that it is possible to spawn\u00a0Autopudate\u00a0manually via Installer XPC service. However this requires the victim to enter credentials upon system authorization dialog creation that can be modified by the attacker.\n\nThis issue was fixed in version 2.7.2", "PRODUIT": ""}
