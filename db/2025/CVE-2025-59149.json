In version 8.0.0, rules using keyword ldap.responses.attribute_type (which is long) with transforms can lead to a stack buffer overflow during Suricata startup or during a rule reload. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules with ldap.responses.attribute_type and transforms.", "PRODUIT": "oisf"}
