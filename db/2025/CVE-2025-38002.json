But enough does that it's a bit unwieldy to manage.\nWrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return\nwith no output if we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will\nalready have greatly diminished utility/output for the failure case.\n\nThis fixes an issue with reading the SQE fields, if the ring is being\nactively resized at the same time.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
