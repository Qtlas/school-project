{"CVE": "CVE-2025-34503", "CWE": ["CWE-1326", "CWE-347"], "DATE": "2025-10-24T23:15:47", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Shuffle Master Deck Mate 1 Unauthenticated EEPROM Firmware Execution", "DESC": "Deck Mate 1 executes firmware directly from an external EEPROM without verifying authenticity or integrity. An attacker with physical access can replace or reflash the EEPROM to run arbitrary code that persists across reboots. Because this design predates modern secure-boot or signed-update mechanisms, affected systems should be physically protected or retired from service. The vendor has not indicated that firmware updates are available for this legacy model.", "VENDOR": []}
