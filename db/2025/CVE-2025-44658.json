An attacker may exploit this by uploading malicious scripts disguised with alternate extensions and tricking the web server into executing them as PHP, bypassing security mechanisms based on file extension filtering. This may lead to remote code execution (RCE), information disclosure, or full system compromise.", "PRODUIT": ["netgear", "netgear$PRODUCT$rax30", "netgear$PRODUCT$rax30_firmware"]}
