This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may become a very small or negative number.\n\n NOTE: This CVE affects only End Of Life (EOL)\u00a0software components. The vendor, Microsoft, has indicated there will be no future updates nor support provided upon inquiry.", "VENDOR": []}
