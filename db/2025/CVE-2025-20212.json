To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid VPN user credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because a variable is not initialized when an SSL VPN session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying crafted attributes while establishing an SSL VPN session with an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of the established SSL VPN sessions and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and reauthenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established.\r\n\r Note: When the attack traffic stops, the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server recovers without manual intervention.", "VENDOR": []}
