This is due to the unsanitized use of user-supplied input in call_user_func(). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level access, to execute arbitrary PHP functions that meet specific constraints (static methods or global functions accepting a single array parameter).", "PRODUIT": ["basixonline", "basixonline$PRODUCT$nex-forms"]}
