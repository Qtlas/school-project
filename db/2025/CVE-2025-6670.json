Although the SameSite=Lax cookie attribute is used as a mitigation, it is ineffective in this context because it allows cookies to be sent with cross-origin top-level navigations using GET requests.\n\nA malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted link, leading the browser to issue unintended state-changing requests. Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized operations such as data modification, account changes, or other administrative actions. According to WSO2 Secure Production Guidelines, exposure of Carbon console services to untrusted networks is discouraged, which may reduce the impact in properly secured deployments.", "VENDOR": ["wso2", "wso2$PRODUCT$api_control_plane", "wso2$PRODUCT$api_manager", "wso2$PRODUCT$enterprise_integrator", "wso2$PRODUCT$identity_server", "wso2$PRODUCT$identity_server_as_key_manager", "wso2$PRODUCT$open_banking_am", "wso2$PRODUCT$open_banking_iam", "wso2$PRODUCT$traffic_manager", "wso2$PRODUCT$universal_gateway"]}
