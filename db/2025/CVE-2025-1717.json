This is due to insecure authentication based on an arbitrary transient name in the 'AutoLogin::listen()' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in an existing user on the site, even an administrator. Note: this vulnerability requires using a transient name and value from another software, so the plugin is not inherently vulnerable on it's own.", "PRODUIT": ["pluginly", "pluginly$PRODUCT$login_me_now"]}
