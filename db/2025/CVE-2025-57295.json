The root user account has no password set, and the H3C user account uses the default password \"admin,\" both stored in the /etc/shadow file. Attackers with network access can exploit these credentials to gain unauthorized root-level access to the device via the administrative interface or other network services, potentially leading to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.", "VENDOR": ["h3c", "h3c$PRODUCT$magic_nx15", "h3c$PRODUCT$magic_nx15_firmware"]}
