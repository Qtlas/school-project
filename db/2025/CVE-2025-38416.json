This also opens some short window if device\nstarts sending data, even before NCIUARTSETDRIVER IOCTL succeeded\n(broken hardware?).  Close the window by exposing tty->disc_data only on\nthe success path, when opening of the NCI device and try_module_get()\nsucceeds.\n\nThe code differs in error path in one aspect: tty->disc_data won't be\never assigned thus NULL-ified.  This however should not be relevant\ndifference, because of \"tty->disc_data=NULL\" in nci_uart_tty_open().", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
