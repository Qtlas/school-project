The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks at\npackets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens are\nunavailable.\n\nThis peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdisc\nqueue length counters. When TBF later receives a high-priority packet,\nSKBPRIO's queue length may show a different value than what's reflected in its\ninternal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.\n\nThe fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are not\nnecessary at all.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
