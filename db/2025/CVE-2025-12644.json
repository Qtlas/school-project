This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied custom field values that are retrieved and rendered by the shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "PRODUIT": ""}
