Those two should always go together, as the flag tells\nio_uring whether the field is valid or not.\n\nAdditionally, on failure cleanup, the futex handler frees the data but\ndoes not clear ->async_data. Clear the data and the flag in the error\npath as well.\n\nThanks to Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative and particularly ReDress for\nreporting this.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
