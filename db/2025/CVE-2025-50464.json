The vulnerability arises due to the unsafe use of the strcpy function to copy attacker-controlled data from the CONTENT_TYPE HTTP header into a fixed-size stack buffer (v8, allocated 8 bytes) without bounds checking. Since this operation occurs before authentication logic is executed, the vulnerability is exploitable pre-authentication.", "VENDOR": ["iptime", "iptime$PRODUCT$nas", "iptime$PRODUCT$nas_firmware"]}
