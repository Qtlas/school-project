When a user adds a DNS entry, the application issues an HTTP POST request to /cgi-bin/dns.cgi and these values are provided in the corresponding parameters. The values are stored and later rendered in the web interface without proper sanitation or encoding, allowing injected scripts to execute in the context of other users who view the affected DNS configuration.", "VENDOR": []}
