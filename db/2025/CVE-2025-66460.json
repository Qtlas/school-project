Prior to 1.35.3, Lookyloo passed improperly escaped values to cells rendered in datatables using the orthogonal-data feature. It is definitely exploitable from the popup view, but it is most probably also exploitable in many other places. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.3.", "VENDOR": ["lookyloo", "lookyloo$PRODUCT$lookyloo"]}
