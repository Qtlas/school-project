This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers.", "PRODUIT": ["wpvivid", "wpvivid$PRODUCT$migration\\,_backup\\,_staging"]}
