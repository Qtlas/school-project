{"CVE": "CVE-2025-0622", "CWE": ["CWE-416"], "DATE": "2025-02-18T20:15:23", "CVSS": 6.4, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Grub2: command/gpg: use-after-free due to hooks not being removed on module unload", "DESC": "A flaw was found in command/gpg. In some scenarios, hooks created by loaded modules are not removed when the related module is unloaded. This flaw allows an attacker to force grub2 to call the hooks once the module that registered it was unloaded, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. If correctly exploited, this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code execution, eventually allowing the attacker to bypass secure boot protections.", "VENDOR": []}
