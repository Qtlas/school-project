Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nUnder a rare timing scenario outside the attacker's control, memory corruption may be observed when DHCP Option 82 is enabled, leading to an FPC crash and affecting packet forwarding. Due to the nature of the heap-based overflow, exploitation of this vulnerability could also lead to remote code execution within the FPC, resulting in complete control of the vulnerable component.\nThis issue affects Junos OS on EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4300, EX4300MP, EX4400, EX4600, EX4650-48Y, and QFX5k Series: \n\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,\u00a0\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2.", "VENDOR": []}
