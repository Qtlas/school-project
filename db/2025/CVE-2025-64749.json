An observable difference in error messaging was found in the Directus REST API in versions of Directus prior to version 11.13.0. The `/items/{collection}` API returns different error messages for two cases: when a user tries to access an existing collection which they are not authorized to access, and when user tries to access a non-existing collection. The two differing error messages leak the existence of collections to users which are not authorized to access these collections. Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue.", "PRODUIT": "monospace"}
