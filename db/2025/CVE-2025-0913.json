On Unix systems, OpenFile with O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags never follows symlinks. On Windows, when the target path was a symlink to a nonexistent location, OpenFile would create a file in that location. OpenFile now always returns an error when the O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags are both set and the target path is a symlink.", "PRODUIT": ["golang", "golang$PRODUCT$go", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows"]}
