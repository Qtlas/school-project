In versions prior to 3.24.1, 3.20.2, and 3.15.6, there is a potential data leak when duplicating a duplicated context. Quarkus extensively uses the Vert.x duplicated context to implement context propagation. With the new semantic data from one transaction can leak to the data from another transaction. From a Vert.x point of view, this new semantic clarifies the behavior. A significant amount of data is stored in the duplicated context, including request scope, security details, and metadata. Duplicating a duplicated context is rather rare and is only done in a few places. This issue has been patched in version 3.24.1, 3.20.2, and 3.15.6.", "VENDOR": []}
