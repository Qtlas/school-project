The platform allows authenticated users, with low-level member privileges, to inject arbitrary shell commands via the Git Repository field during project creation. By submitting a crafted repository string containing command injection syntax, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying host system, resulting in full server compromise.", "VENDOR": ["coollabs", "coollabs$PRODUCT$coolify"]}
