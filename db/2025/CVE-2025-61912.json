In versions prior to 3.4.5, ldap.dn.escape_dn_chars() escapes \\x00 incorrectly by emitting a backslash followed by a literal NUL byte instead of the RFC-4514 hex form \\00. Any application that uses this helper to construct DNs from untrusted input can be made to consistently fail before a request is sent to the LDAP server (e.g., AD), resulting in a client-side denial of service. Version 3.4.5 contains a patch for the issue.", "VENDOR": ["python-ldap", "python-ldap$PRODUCT$python-ldap"]}
