An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an egress ACL on the affected device.\r\nFor more information about this vulnerability, see the  section of this advisory.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$8608", "cisco$PRODUCT$8804", "cisco$PRODUCT$8808", "cisco$PRODUCT$8812", "cisco$PRODUCT$8818", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5504", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5508", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5516"]}
