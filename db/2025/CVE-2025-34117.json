Exact version boundaries remain undocumented. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted UDP packets to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This backdoor uses a hardcoded authentication mechanism and accepts shell commands post-authentication. Some device models include a non-standard implementation of the `echo` command, which may affect exploitability.", "PRODUIT": ""}
