The application improperly passes the HTTP Basic Authentication password directly to a call to exec() without adequate sanitation. This allows remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web server user. NOTE: This vulnerability was mitigated in 2017.", "VENDOR": []}
