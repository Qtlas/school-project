This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability can be paired with CVE-2025-4798 to delete any file within the WordPress root directory.", "VENDOR": ["wp-downloadmanager_project", "wp-downloadmanager_project$PRODUCT$wp-downloadmanager"]}
