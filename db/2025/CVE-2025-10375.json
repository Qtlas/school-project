This is due to missing nonce validation on multiple AJAX actions including accessibe_signup, accessibe_login, accessibe_license_trial, accessibe_modify_config, and accessibe_add_verification_page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings and create verification files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
