The MailEnable administrative executable attempts to load MEAISO.DLL from its installation directory without sufficient integrity validation or a secure search order. A local attacker with write access to that directory can plant a malicious MEAISO.DLL, which is then loaded when the executable starts, resulting in execution of attacker-controlled code with the privileges of the process.", "VENDOR": ["mailenable", "mailenable$PRODUCT$mailenable"]}
