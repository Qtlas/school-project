This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Please note that this requires the 'Private Message' module to be enabled and the Business version of the PRO software to be in use.", "PRODUIT": ""}
