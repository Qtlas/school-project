Updating rd_offset prematurely can lead to the host accessing\nan uninitialized or incomplete element, resulting in data corruption.\n\nInvoke the buffer write before updating rd_offset to ensure the element\nis fully written before signaling its availability.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
