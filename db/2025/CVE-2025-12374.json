This is due to the plugin not properly validating that an OTP was generated before comparing it to user input in the \"user_verification_form_wrap_process_otpLogin\" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user with a verified email address, such as an administrator, by submitting an empty OTP value.", "VENDOR": []}
