An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a crafted file into a specific location on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code at boot time.\r\n\r Because this allows the attacker to bypass a major security feature of the device, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from Medium to High.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960cx-8pc-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960cx-8tc-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-24pd-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-24ps-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-24psq-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-24psq-l_cool", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-24td-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-24ts-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-24ts-ll", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-48fpd-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-48fps-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-48lpd-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-48lps-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-48td-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-48ts-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960x-48ts-ll", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24pd-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24pd-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24ps-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24ps-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24td-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24td-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24ts-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-24ts-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48fpd-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48fpd-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48fps-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48fps-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48lpd-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48lpd-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48lps-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48lps-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48td-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48td-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48ts-i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_2960xr-48ts-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3560cx-12pc-s", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3560cx-12pd-s", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3560cx-12tc-s", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3560cx-8pc-s", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3560cx-8pt-s", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3560cx-8tc-s", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3560cx-8xpd-s", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios"]}
