The vulnerability resides in the prompt parameter submitted to the /dashboard/user/generator/generate-stream endpoint via a multipart/form-data POST request. Due to insufficient input sanitization, attackers can inject HTML-based JavaScript payloads. This payload is stored and rendered unsanitized in subsequent views, leading to execution in other users' browsers when they access affected content. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially leading to session hijacking, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application does not implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) or adequate input filtering to prevent such attacks. A fix should include proper sanitization, output encoding, and strong CSP enforcement to mitigate exploitation.", "VENDOR": ["liquidlabs", "liquidlabs$PRODUCT$magicai"]}
