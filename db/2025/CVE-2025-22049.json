When the data buffer length\nis too small, the hardware may make an error writing cacheline. Thus, it\nis dangerous to allocate a small memory buffer for DMA. It's always safe\nto define ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN as L1_CACHE_BYTES but unnecessary (kmalloc()\nneed small memory objects). Therefore, just increase it to 16.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
