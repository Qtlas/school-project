This is due to insufficient sanitization in the 'newcodebyte_chatbot_export_messages' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.", "PRODUIT": ""}
