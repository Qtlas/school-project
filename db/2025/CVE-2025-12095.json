This is due to missing nonce validation on the role requests admin page handler in the includes/display-role-admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve pending role requests and escalate user privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
