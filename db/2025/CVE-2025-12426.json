This is due to the plugin exposing quiz answers through the ays_quiz_check_answer AJAX action without proper authorization checks. The endpoint only validates a nonce, but that same nonce is publicly available to all site visitors via the quiz_maker_ajax_public localized script data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including quiz answers for any quiz question.", "VENDOR": ["ays-pro", "ays-pro$PRODUCT$quiz_maker"]}
