All users of Nautobot versions prior to 2.4.10 or prior to 1.6.32 are potentially affected. Due to insufficient security configuration of the Jinja2 templating feature used in computed fields, custom links, etc. in Nautobot, a malicious user could configure this feature set in ways that could expose the value of Secrets defined in Nautobot when the templated content is rendered or that could call Python APIs to modify data within Nautobot when the templated content is rendered, bypassing the object permissions assigned to the viewing user. Nautobot versions 1.6.32 and 2.4.10 will include fixes for the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be partially mitigated by configuring object permissions appropriately to limit certain actions to only trusted users.", "PRODUIT": "networktocode"}
