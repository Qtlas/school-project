Prior to version 0.17.13, the skip field in the built-in `label-sheet` plugin lacks an upper bound, so a large value forces the server to allocate an enormous Python list. This lets any authenticated label-printing user trigger a denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. the issue is fixed in versions 0.17.13 and higher. No workaround is available aside from upgrading to the patched version.", "VENDOR": ["inventree_project", "inventree_project$PRODUCT$inventree"]}
