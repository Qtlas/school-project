This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the `image_path` input to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. The issue arises due to improper validation or sanitization of the file path, enabling path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended directory. The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.12.41.", "VENDOR": ["llamaindex", "llamaindex$PRODUCT$llamaindex"]}
