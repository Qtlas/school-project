This is due to the plugin registering a public REST API endpoint without implementing authorization checks to verify request authenticity. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily modify WooCommerce order statuses via the /wp-json/helloprint/v1/complete_order_from_helloprint_callback endpoint by providing a valid order reference ID.", "VENDOR": []}
