Versions 1.26.3 and below do not properly terminate the session during logout. After a user logs out, the session cookie remains active and unchanged. The unchanged cookie could be reused by an attacker if a new session were to be started. This failure to invalidate the session can lead to session hijacking and fixation vulnerabilities. This issue is fixed in version 1.27.0", "VENDOR": ["freshrss", "freshrss$PRODUCT$freshrss"]}
