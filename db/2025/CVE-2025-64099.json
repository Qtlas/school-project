{"CVE": "CVE-2025-64099", "CWE": ["CWE-74"], "DATE": "2025-11-12T19:15:38.087000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "OpenAM allows use of arbitrary OIDC requested claims values in id_token and user_info", "DESC": "Open Access Management (OpenAM) is an access management solution. In versions prior to 16.0.0, if the \"claims_parameter_supported\" parameter is activated, it is possible, thanks to the \"oidc-claims-extension.groovy\" script, to inject the value of one's choice into a claim contained in the id_token or in the user_info. In the request of an authorize function, a claims parameter containing a JSON file can be injected. This JSON file allows attackers to customize the claims returned by the \"id_token\" and \"user_info\" files. This allows for a very wide range of vulnerabilities depending on how clients use claims. For example, if some clients rely on an email field to identify a user, an attacker can choose the email address they want, and therefore assume any identity they choose. Version 16.0.0 fixes the issue.", "VENDOR": []}
