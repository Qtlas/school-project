This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity via the 'wp-json/lazytasks/api/v1/user/role/edit/' REST API endpoint prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account. It is also possible for attackers to abuse this endpoint to grant users with access to additional roles within the plugin", "VENDOR": []}
