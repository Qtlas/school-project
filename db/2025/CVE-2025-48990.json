{"CVE": "CVE-2025-48990", "CWE": ["CWE-122"], "DATE": "2025-06-02T12:15:25", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "NeKernel has Heap Overflow in `rt_copy_memory`", "DESC": "NeKernal is a free and open-source operating system stack. Version 0.0.2 has a 1-byte heap overflow in `rt_copy_memory`, which unconditionally wrote a null terminator at `dst[len]`. When `len` equals the size of the destination buffer (256 bytes), that extra `'\\0'` write overruns the buffer by one byte. To avoid breaking existing callers or changing the public API, the patch in commit fb7b7f658327f659c6a6da1af151cb389c2ca4ee takes a minimal approach: it simply removes the overflow-causing line without adding bounds checks or altering the function signature.", "VENDOR": []}
