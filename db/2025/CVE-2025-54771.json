The flaw occurs because the file-closing process incorrectly retains a memory pointer, leaving an invalid reference to a file system structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause grub to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Possible data integrity or confidentiality compromise is not discarded.", "VENDOR": []}
