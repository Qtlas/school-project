This is due to a logic error in the CTA save function that reads sanitization callbacks from the wrong variable ($custom_field_name instead of $custom_field_options), causing the sanitization to never be applied. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute when a user accesses an injected page.\",", "VENDOR": []}
