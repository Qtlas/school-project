Prior to version 2025-01a, a vulnerability in mailcow's password reset functionality allows an attacker to manipulate the `Host HTTP` header to generate a password reset link pointing to an attacker-controlled domain. This can lead to account takeover if a user clicks the poisoned link. Version 2025-01a contains a patch. As a workaround, deactivate the password reset functionality by clearing `Notification email sender` and `Notification email subject` under System -> Configuration -> Options -> Password Settings.", "VENDOR": ["mailcow", "mailcow$PRODUCT$mailcow\\"]}
