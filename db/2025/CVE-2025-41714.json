{"CVE": "CVE-2025-41714", "CWE": ["CWE-22"], "DATE": "2025-09-10T07:15:44", "CVSS": 8.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Path Traversal via 'Upload-Key' in SmartEMS Upload Handling", "DESC": "The upload endpoint insufficiently validates the 'Upload-Key' request header. By supplying path traversal sequences, an authenticated attacker can cause the server to create upload-related artifacts outside the intended storage location. In certain configurations this enables arbitrary file write and may be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.", "VENDOR": []}
