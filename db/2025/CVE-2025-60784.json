{"CVE": "CVE-2025-60784", "CWE": ["CWE-284", "CWE-285"], "DATE": "2025-11-05T21:15:35", "CVSS": 6.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "TITLE": null, "DESC": "A vulnerability in the XiaozhangBang Voluntary Like System V8.8 allows remote attackers to manipulate the zhekou parameter in the /topfirst.php Pay module, enabling unauthorized discounts. By sending a crafted HTTP POST request with zhekou set to an abnormally low value, an attacker can purchase votes at a reduced cost. Furthermore, by modifying the zid parameter, attackers can influence purchases made by other users, amplifying the impact. This issue stems from insufficient server-side validation of these parameters, potentially leading to economic loss and unfair manipulation of vote counts.", "VENDOR": []}
