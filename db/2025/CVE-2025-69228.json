Versions 3.13.2 and below allow a request to be crafted in such a way that an AIOHTTP server's memory fills up uncontrollably during processing. If an application includes a handler that uses the Request.post() method, an attacker may be able to freeze the server by exhausting the memory. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.", "VENDOR": []}
