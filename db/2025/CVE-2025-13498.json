This is due to missing authorization and capability checks on the `wpdm_media_access` AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve passwords and access control settings for protected media attachments, which can then be used to bypass the intended media protection and download restricted files.", "PRODUIT": ""}
