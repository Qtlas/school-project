The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an architectural flaw in the password generation algorithm for the remote access functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a temporary password for the service account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying operating system.\r\nNote: The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is Medium due to the unrestricted scope of information that is accessible to an attacker.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asyncos", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m170", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m190", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m195", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m380", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m390", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m390x", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m395", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m680", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m690", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m690x", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_m695", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_virtual_appliance_m100v", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_virtual_appliance_m300v", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager_virtual_appliance_m600v"]}
