Versions 0.34.1 and below allow for deseriaization of untrusted data because of the way the DataChain library reads serialized objects from environment variables (such as DATACHAIN__METASTORE and DATACHAIN__WAREHOUSE) in the loader.py module. An attacker with the ability to set these environment variables can trigger code execution when the application loads. This issue is fixed in version 0.34.2.", "VENDOR": []}
