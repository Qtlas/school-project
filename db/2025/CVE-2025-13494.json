This is due to the plugin storing PHP error logs in a predictable, web-accessible location (wp-content/uploads/ssp-debug/ssp-debug.log) without any access controls. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive debugging information including full URLs, client IP addresses, User-Agent strings, WordPress user IDs, and internal filesystem paths.", "VENDOR": []}
