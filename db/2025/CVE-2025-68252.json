However, this reference is never\nreleased when the function returns, leading to a dma_buf memory leak.\n\nFix this by adding dma_buf_put before returning from the function,\nensuring that the temporarily acquired reference is properly released\nregardless of whether a matching map is found.\n\nRule: add", "VENDOR": []}
