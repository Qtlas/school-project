The application implements lock screen password logic entirely on the client side using JavaScript within an Electron resource file. Because the password is stored and returned via a modifiable JavaScript property(a.settingsManager.lockScreenPassword), an attacker can patch the return value to bypass authentication. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the lock-screen bypass would only occur if the local user modified his own instance of the application.", "VENDOR": ["reolink", "reolink$PRODUCT$reolink"]}
