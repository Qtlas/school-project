This is due to the plugin exposing a public AJAX endpoint that retrieves form submission data without performing authorization checks to verify ownership or access rights. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive form submission data including personal information, payment details, and other private data via the rocket_front_payment_seesummary action by enumerating sequential form_r_id values.", "VENDOR": []}
