{"CVE": "CVE-2025-34095", "CWE": ["CWE-78"], "DATE": "2025-07-10T20:15:24.953000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Mako Server v2.5 and v2.6 OS Command Injection via examples/save.lsp", "DESC": "An OS command injection vulnerability exists in Mako Server versions 2.5 and 2.6, specifically within the tutorial interface provided by the examples/save.lsp endpoint. An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted PUT request containing arbitrary Lua os.execute() code, which is then persisted on disk and triggered via a subsequent GET request to examples/manage.lsp. This allows remote command execution on the underlying operating system, impacting both Windows and Unix-based deployments.", "VENDOR": []}
