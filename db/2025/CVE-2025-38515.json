If this race occurs, job\nscheduling stops, leading to hangs while waiting on the job\u2019s DMA\nfences.\n\nSeal this race by incrementing the job count before appending to the\nSPSC queue.\n\nThis race was observed on a drm-tip 6.16-rc1 build with the Xe driver in\nan SVM test case.", "VENDOR": []}
