This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable in the plugin's settings page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
