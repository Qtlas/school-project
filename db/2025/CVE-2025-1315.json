This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "VENDOR": ["sfwebservice", "sfwebservice$PRODUCT$injob"]}
