This replaces the current\npattern of calling alloc_anon_inode() followed by\ninode_init_security_anon() for creating security context manually.\n\nThis change also fixes a security regression in secretmem where the\nS_PRIVATE flag was not cleared after alloc_anon_inode(), causing\nLSM/SELinux checks to be bypassed for secretmem file descriptors.\n\nAs guest_memfd currently resides in the KVM module, we need to export this\nsymbol for use outside the core kernel. In the future, guest_memfd might be\nmoved to core-mm, at which point the symbols no longer would have to be\nexported. When/if that happens is still unclear.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
