These tokens are generated by hashing the current timestamp formatted as \"%d %H:%M:%S\" without incorporating any user-specific data or cryptographic randomness. This predictability allows remote attackers to brute-force valid tokens within a small time window, enabling unauthorized account confirmation, password resets, and email change approvals, potentially leading to account takeover.", "VENDOR": []}
