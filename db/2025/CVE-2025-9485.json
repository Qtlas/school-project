This is due to the plugin performing unsafe JWT token processing without verification or validation in the `get_resource_owner_from_id_token` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and gain access to any existing user account - including administrators in certain configurations - or to create arbitrary subscriber-level accounts.", "PRODUIT": ""}
