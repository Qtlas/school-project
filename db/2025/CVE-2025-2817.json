By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 138, Firefox ESR < 128.10, Firefox ESR < 115.23, Thunderbird < 138, and Thunderbird < 128.10.", "VENDOR": ["mozilla", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox", "mozilla$PRODUCT$thunderbird"]}
