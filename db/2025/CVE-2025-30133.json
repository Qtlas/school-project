Bypass of Device Pairing/Registration can occur. It requires device registration via the \"IROAD X View\" app for authentication, but its HTTP server lacks this restriction. Once connected to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network via the default password (\"qwertyuiop\"), an attacker can directly access the HTTP server at http://192.168.10.1 without undergoing the pairing process. Additionally, no alert is triggered on the device when an attacker connects, making this intrusion completely silent.", "VENDOR": ["iroadau", "iroadau$PRODUCT$fx2", "iroadau$PRODUCT$fx2_firmware"]}
