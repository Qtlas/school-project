{"CVE": "CVE-2025-60010", "CWE": ["CWE-262"], "DATE": "2025-10-09 17:16:04", "SCORE": 5.4, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved: Device allows login for user with expired password", "DESC": "A password aging vulnerability in the RADIUS client of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an authenticated, network-based attacker to access the device without enforcing the required password change.\n\nAffected devices allow logins by users for whom the RADIUS server has responded with a reject and required the user to change the password as their password was expired. Therefore the policy mandating the password change is not enforced.\nThis does not allow users to login with a wrong password, but only with the correct but expired one.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS:\u00a0\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S4,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S5,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S1,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2;\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-S8-EVO,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S4-EVO,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S5-EVO,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2-S1-EVO,\n  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R1-S3-EVO, 24.4R2-EVO.", "PRODUIT": ""}
