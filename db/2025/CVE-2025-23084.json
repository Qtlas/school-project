Certain Node.js functions do not treat drive names as special on Windows. As a result, although Node.js assumes a relative path, it actually refers to the root directory.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, a path that does not start with the file separator is treated as relative to the current directory. \r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects Windows users of `path.join` API.", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "nodejs", "nodejs$PRODUCT$node.js"]}
