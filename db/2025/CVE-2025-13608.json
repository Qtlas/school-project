This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on four user-supplied attributes (use_custom_link, use_custom_link_target, use_custom_thumbs, and use_custom_excerpt) in the 'show_child_pages' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "PRODUIT": ""}
