This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_shortcode_submit, admin_configuration_submit, and admin_shortcode_delete functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "PRODUIT": ""}
