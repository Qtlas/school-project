When that happens, the call\nto put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call\nwhich deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged.\n\nInstead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close()\ncatches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
