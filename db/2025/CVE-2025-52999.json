{"CVE": "CVE-2025-52999", "CWE": ["CWE-121"], "DATE": "2025-06-25T17:15:39", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "jackson-core Has Potential for StackoverflowError if user parses an input file that contains very deeply nested data", "DESC": "jackson-core contains core low-level incremental (\"streaming\") parser and generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. In versions prior to 2.15.0, if a user parses an input file and it has deeply nested data, Jackson could end up throwing a StackoverflowError if the depth is particularly large. jackson-core 2.15.0 contains a configurable limit for how deep Jackson will traverse in an input document, defaulting to an allowable depth of 1000. jackson-core will throw a StreamConstraintsException if the limit is reached. jackson-databind also benefits from this change because it uses jackson-core to parse JSON inputs. As a workaround, users should avoid parsing input files from untrusted sources.", "VENDOR": []}
