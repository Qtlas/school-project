In versions up to and including 2.5.9, SQL injection occurs because the $origContent parameter in admin/article_save.php is not strictly filtered. Since admin/article_save.php can be accessed by ordinary registered users, this will cause SQL injection to occur when the registered site is enabled, resulting in the injection of the admin account and password, which is then exploited by the backend remote code execution. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a fix exists.", "PRODUIT": ["emlog", "emlog$PRODUCT$emlog"]}
