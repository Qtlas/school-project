Prior to version 3.4.4 of the `stable` branch, version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch, and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev of the `tests-passed` branch, Codepen is present in the default `allowed_iframes` site setting, and it can potentially auto-run arbitrary JS in the iframe scope, which is unintended. This issue is patched in version 3.4.4 of the `stable` branch, version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch, and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, the Codepen prefix can be removed from a site's `allowed_iframes`.", "VENDOR": ["discourse", "discourse$PRODUCT$discourse"]}
