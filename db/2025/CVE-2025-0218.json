In versions of pgAgent prior to 4.2.3, an insufficiently seeded random number generator is used when generating the directory name, leading to the possibility for a local attacker to pre-create the directory and thus prevent pgAgent from executing jobs, disrupting scheduled tasks.", "PRODUIT": ["pgadmin", "pgadmin$PRODUCT$pgagent"]}
