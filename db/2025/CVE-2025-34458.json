When processing a specially crafted AX.25 frame containing a MIC-E message with an empty or truncated comment field, the application triggers an unhandled assertion checking for a non-empty comment. This assertion failure causes immediate process termination, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by sending malformed APRS traffic.", "PRODUIT": ""}
