This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ELISQLREPORTS_menu' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Version 5.25.10 adds a nonce check, which makes this vulnerability exploitable by admins only.", "PRODUIT": ""}
