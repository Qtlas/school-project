If critical system files are manipulated, new Remote Access SSL VPN sessions could be denied and existing sessions could be dropped, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. An exploited device requires a manual reboot to recover.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create or delete files on the underlying operating system, which could cause the Remote Access SSL VPN service to become unresponsive.\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be authenticated as a VPN user of the affected device.", "VENDOR": []}
