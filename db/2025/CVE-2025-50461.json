The script calls torch.load() with weights_only=False on user-supplied .pt files, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code if a maliciously crafted model file is loaded. An attacker can exploit this by convincing a victim to download and place a malicious model file in a local directory with a specific filename pattern. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the script.", "PRODUIT": ""}
