An attacker who intercepts or captures a valid OTP response can bypass the OTP verification step by replaying the same response. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because, by design, the product successfully authenticates a client that possesses a cookie whose validity time interval includes the current time, and thus authentication after any type of \"interception\" is not a violation of the security model. (The cookie has the HttpOnly attribute.)", "PRODUIT": ["quest", "quest$PRODUCT$one_identity"]}
