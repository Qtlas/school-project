{"CVE": "CVE-2025-0838", "CWE": ["CWE-190"], "DATE": "2025-02-21T15:15:11", "CVSS": 9.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Heap Buffer overflow in Abseil", "DESC": "There exists a heap buffer overflow vulnerable in Abseil-cpp. The sized constructors, reserve(), and rehash() methods of absl::{flat,node}hash{set,map} did not impose an upper bound on their size argument. As a result, it was possible for a caller to pass a very large size that would cause an integer overflow when computing the size of the container's backing store, and a subsequent out-of-bounds memory write. Subsequent accesses to the container might also access out-of-bounds memory.
