The application fails to validate serialized input to the admin backup endpoint (`index.php/admin/update/sa/backup`), allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths using a crafted `datasupdateinfo` payload. The files are packaged in a ZIP archive and made available for download without authentication. This vulnerability can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the host system, including sensitive OS and configuration files.", "VENDOR": []}
