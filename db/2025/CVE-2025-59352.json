Prior to 2.1.0, the gRPC API and HTTP APIs allow peers to send requests that force the recipient peer to create files in arbitrary file system locations, and to read arbitrary files. This allows peers to steal other peers\u2019 secret data and to gain remote code execution (RCE) capabilities on the peer\u2019s machine.This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.", "VENDOR": ["linuxfoundation", "linuxfoundation$PRODUCT$dragonfly"]}
