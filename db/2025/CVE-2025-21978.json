If the device removed, or in the error\npath for device probing, the MMIO space is released but no unmap is done.\nConsequently the kernel address space for the mapping is leaked.\n\nFix this by adding iounmap() calls in the device removal path, and in the\nerror path during device probing.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
