In versions 2.52.8 and below, when using Fiber's Ctx.BodyParser to parse form data containing a large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g., test.18446744073704), the application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema decoder. The root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length idx + 1 without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range. If the idx is excessively large, this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion, causing a panic or crash. This is fixed in version 2.52.9.", "PRODUIT": ["gofiber", "gofiber$PRODUCT$fiber"]}
