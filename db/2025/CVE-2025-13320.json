{"CVE": "CVE-2025-13320", "CWE": ["CWE-73"], "DATE": "2025-12-12 04:15:41", "SCORE": 6.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "WP User Manager <= 2.9.12 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion via 'current_user_avatar' Parameter", "DESC": "The WP User Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.12. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied file paths in the profile update functionality combined with improper handling of array inputs by PHP's filter_input() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server via the 'current_user_avatar' parameter in a two-stage attack which can make remote code execution possible. This only affects sites with the custom avatar setting enabled.", "PRODUIT": ""}
