The plugin\u2019s image\u2010upload handler calls move_uploaded_file() on client\u2010supplied files without restricting allowed extensions or MIME types, nor sanitizing the filename. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "PRODUIT": ""}
