Prior to version 2.69.1, the OAuth client creation and update endpoints of the Fides Webserver API do not properly authorize scope assignment. This allows highly privileged users with `client:create` or `client:update` permissions to escalate their privileges to owner-level. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "VENDOR": ["ethyca", "ethyca$PRODUCT$fides"]}
