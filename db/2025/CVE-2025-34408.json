The Added value is not properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected in the response, allowing an attacker to break out of existing markup and inject arbitrary script. A remote attacker can supply a crafted payload that closes an existing HTML list element, inserts attacker-controlled JavaScript, and comments out remaining code, leading to script execution in a victim\u2019s browser when the victim visits a malicious link. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to malicious sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies, inject arbitrary HTML or CSS, and perform actions as the authenticated user.", "VENDOR": ["mailenable", "mailenable$PRODUCT$mailenable"]}
