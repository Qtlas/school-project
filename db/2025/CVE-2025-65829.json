The Secure Boot feature ensures that only authenticated software can execute on the device. The Secure Boot process forms a chain of trust by verifying all mutable software entities involved in the Application Startup Flow. As a result, an attacker with physical access to the device can flash modified firmware to the device, resulting in the execution of malicious code upon startup.", "PRODUIT": ["meatmeet", "meatmeet$PRODUCT$meatmeet_pro_wifi_\\&_bluetooth_meat_thermometer", "meatmeet$PRODUCT$meatmeet_pro_wifi_\\&_bluetooth_meat_thermometer_firmware"]}
