However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the\ntraversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the\nactual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.\nIn case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.\n\nPrevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT\n(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
