This vulnerability occurs due to the insecure termination of a regular expression check within the endpoint. Because the input is not correctly validated or sanitized, an unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands through a crafted HTTP request, leading to remote code execution on the server in the context of the web application service account.", "VENDOR": []}
