An authenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by submitting crafted filter expressions to the log_filter endpoint using the filterStr parameter. This input is processed by a backend parser that permits execution of file expansion syntax, allowing the attacker to retrieve arbitrary system files via the log viewing interface.", "VENDOR": []}
