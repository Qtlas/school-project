NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the product's objective is \"to discourage automated scraping / bots, not guarantee resistance to determined attackers.\" The documentation states \u201cthe goal is not to provide a secure cryptographic algorithm but to use a proof-of-work mechanism that allows any capable device to decrypt the hidden data.\u201d", "VENDOR": []}
