LibreNMS versions 25.6.0 and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/, without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path \u2014 for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 25.7.0.", "PRODUIT": ["librenms", "librenms$PRODUCT$librenms"]}
