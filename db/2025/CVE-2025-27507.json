ZITADEL's Admin API contains Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities that allow authenticated users, without specific IAM roles, to modify sensitive settings.

Customers who do not utilize LDAP for authentication are not at risk from the most severe aspects of this vulnerability. However, upgrading to the patched version to address all identified issues is strongly recommended.
