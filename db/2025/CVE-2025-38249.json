This length is controlled by the USB device.\n\nThe allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor\nand its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer\nis large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected\nlength, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.\n\nAdd a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for\nuac3_cluster_header_descriptor.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
