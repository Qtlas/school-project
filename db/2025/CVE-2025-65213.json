The compare_for_single_op() and nan_inf_track_for_single_op() functions use pickle.load() on user-controlled file paths without validation, allowing arbitrary code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious pickle file that executes arbitrary Python code when loaded, enabling remote code execution with the privileges of the victim process.", "VENDOR": []}
