For a successful attack, the attacker needs developer authorization in a specific Application Server ABAP to make changes in the code, and the victim needs to execute by using SAP GUI for Windows. This could trigger automatic NTLM authentication, potentially exposing hashed credentials to an attacker. As a result, it has a high impact on the confidentiality.", "VENDOR": []}
