This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the 'jay_login_register_process_switch_back' function with the 'jay_login_register_process_switch_back' cookie value. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id.", "PRODUIT": ""}
