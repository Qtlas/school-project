It identifies itself as a device without input or output capabilities, which results in the use of the Just Works pairing method. This method does not implement any authentication, which therefore allows machine-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, this lack of authentication allows attackers to interact with the device via BLE without requiring prior authorization.", "VENDOR": ["yftech", "yftech$PRODUCT$coros_pace_3", "yftech$PRODUCT$coros_pace_3_firmware"]}
