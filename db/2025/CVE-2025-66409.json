{"CVE": "CVE-2025-66409", "CWE": ["CWE-125"], "DATE": "2025-12-02T19:15:52", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "ESF-IDF has an Out-of-Bounds Read in ESP32 Bluetooth AVRCP Command Handling", "DESC": "ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In 5.5.1, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, 5.1.6, and earlier, when AVRCP is enabled on ESP32, receiving a malformed VENDOR DEPENDENT command from a peer device can cause the Bluetooth stack to access memory before validating the command buffer length. This may lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially exposing unintended memory content or causing unexpected behavior.", "VENDOR": []}
