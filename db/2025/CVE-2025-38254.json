The latter was reported\nactually when connected with a bad adapter.\n\nAdd sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner\ncases, and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
