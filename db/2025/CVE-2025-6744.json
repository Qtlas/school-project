This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode through the woodmart_get_products_shortcode() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.", "VENDOR": ["xtemos", "xtemos$PRODUCT$woodmart"]}
