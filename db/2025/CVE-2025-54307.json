The /configure/plugins/plugin/upload/zip/ and /configure/newupdates/offline/bundle/upload/ endpoints allow low-privilege users to upload ZIP files to the server. The plupload_file_upload function handles these file uploads and constructs the destination file path by using either the name parameter or the uploaded filename, neither of which is properly sanitized. The file extension is extracted by splitting the filename, and a format string is used to construct the final file path, leaving the destination path vulnerable to path traversal. An authenticated attacker with network connectivity can write arbitrary files to the server, enabling remote code execution after overwriting an executable file. An example is the pdflatex executable, which is executed through subprocess.Popen in the write_report_pdf function after requests to a /report/latex/(\\d+).pdf endpoint.", "VENDOR": ["thermofisher", "thermofisher$PRODUCT$torrent_suite_software"]}
