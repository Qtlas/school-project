For versions prior to 2.11.32 and 2.11.31 through 3.6.2, requests using PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matchers can bypass path normalization. When Traefik uses path-based routing, requests containing URL-encoded restricted characters (/, \\, Null, ;, ?, #) can bypass the middleware chain and reach unintended backends. For example, a request to http://mydomain.example.com/admin%2F could reach service-a without triggering my-security-middleware, bypassing security controls for the /admin/ path. This issue is fixed in versions 2.11.32 and 3.6.3.", "PRODUIT": "traefik"}
