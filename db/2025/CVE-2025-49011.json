Prior to version 1.44.2, on schemas involving arrows with caveats on the arrow\u2019ed relation, when the path to resolve a CheckPermission request involves the evaluation of multiple caveated branches, requests may return a negative response when a positive response is expected. Version 1.44.2 fixes the issue. As a workaround, do not use caveats in the schema over an arrow\u2019ed relation.", "VENDOR": ["authzed", "authzed$PRODUCT$spicedb"]}
