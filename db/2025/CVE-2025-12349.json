{"CVE": "CVE-2025-12349", "CWE": ["CWE-306"], "DATE": "2025-11-19T05:16:00.083000+00:00", "CVSS": 5.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Email Subscribers & Newsletters <= 5.9.10 - Missing Authentication to Unauthenticated Mailing Queue Trigger", "DESC": "The Icegram Express - Email Subscribers, Newsletters and Marketing Automation Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authorization in versions up to, and including, 5.9.10. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the `trigger_mailing_queue_sending` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force immediate email sending, bypass the schedule, increase server load, and change plugin state (e.g., last-cron-hit), enabling abuse or DoS-like effects.", "VENDOR": []}
