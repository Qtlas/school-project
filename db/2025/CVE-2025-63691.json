This interface can be called by any user who has completed login authentication, and it returns the plaintext authentication Tokens of all users currently logged in to the system. As a result, ordinary users can obtain the administrator's authentication Token through this interface, thereby forging an administrator account, gaining the system's management permissions, and taking over the system.", "VENDOR": ["pig4cloud", "pig4cloud$PRODUCT$pig"]}
