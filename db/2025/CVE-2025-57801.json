In versions prior to 0.14.0, the Verify function in eddsa.go and ecdsa.go used the S value from a signature without asserting that 0 \u2264 S < order, leading to a signature malleability vulnerability. Because gnark\u2019s native EdDSA and ECDSA circuits lack essential constraints, multiple distinct witnesses can satisfy the same public inputs. In protocols where nullifiers or anti-replay checks are derived from R and S, this enables signature malleability and may allow double spending. This issue has been addressed in version 0.14.0.", "VENDOR": ["consensys", "consensys$PRODUCT$gnark"]}
