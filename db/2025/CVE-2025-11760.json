This is due to the plugin exposing Zoom SDK secret keys in client-side JavaScript within the meeting view template. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract the sdk_secret value, which should remain server-side, compromising the security of the Zoom integration and allowing attackers to generate valid JWT signatures for unauthorized meeting access.", "VENDOR": []}
