The FieldBcc value is not properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected inside a <script> block in the JavaScript variable var BCCFieldProvided. By supplying a crafted payload that terminates the existing LoadCurAddresses() function, inserts attacker-controlled script, and comments out remaining code, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim\u2019s browser during normal email composition. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to malicious sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies, inject arbitrary HTML or CSS, and perform actions as the authenticated user.", "VENDOR": ["mailenable", "mailenable$PRODUCT$mailenable"]}
