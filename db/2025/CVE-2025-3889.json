This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the quantity of a product to a negative number, which subtracts the product cost from the total order cost. The attack will only work with Manual Checkout mode, as PayPal and Stripe will not process payments for a negative quantity.", "PRODUIT": ["tipsandtricks-hq", "tipsandtricks-hq$PRODUCT$wordpress_simple_paypal_shopping_cart"]}
