This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in the admin panel (and potentially on the frontend) whenever a user accesses imported reviews, granted they can add a malicious review to a Google Place that is connected to the vulnerable site.", "VENDOR": []}
