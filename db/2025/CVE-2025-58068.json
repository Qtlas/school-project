Prior to version 0.40.3, the Eventlet WSGI parser is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of HTTP trailer sections. This vulnerability could enable attackers to, bypass front-end security controls, launch targeted attacks against active site users, and poison web caches. This problem has been patched in Eventlet 0.40.3 by dropping trailers which is a breaking change if a backend behind eventlet.wsgi proxy requires trailers. A workaround involves not using eventlet.wsgi facing untrusted clients.", "VENDOR": ["eventlet", "eventlet$PRODUCT$eventlet"]}
