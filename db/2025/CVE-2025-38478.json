The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions\nallocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this,\nbut they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codes\nthat write to the subdevice, the first `insn->n` data elements are\ncopied from user-space, but the remaining elements are left\nuninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction\nhandler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first\n`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction\nhandlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are used for\nhandling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES`\nelements are initialized for each instruction that writes to the\nsubdevice.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
