The Admin CLI command used to configure Certificate access to the initial startup of the container sets a property of \"allowany\" to allow any user with a valid and trusted client auth certificate to connect. Admins can then set more restricted access to specific certificates. A logic error caused this admin CLI command to be run on each restart of the container instead of only the first startup as intended resetting the configuration to \"allowany\".", "VENDOR": ["keyfactor", "keyfactor$PRODUCT$signserver"]}
