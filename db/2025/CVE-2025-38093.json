With certain high GPU loads it is possible to\nreach the critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120\u00b0C, endangering the\nhardware and making it impossible to run certain applications.\n\nSet up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables, by throttling the GPU speed\nwhen reaching 95\u00b0C and polling every 200ms.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
