When a special crafted packet is received via SslHandler it doesn't correctly handle validation of such a packet in all cases which can lead to a native crash. Version 4.1.118.Final contains a patch. As workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine or change the code manually.", "VENDOR": ["netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_insight", "netty", "netty$PRODUCT$netty"]}
