The MailEnable administrative executable attempts to load MEAIAU.DLL from its installation directory without sufficient integrity validation or a secure search order. A local attacker with write access to that directory can plant a malicious MEAIAU.DLL, which is then loaded on execution, resulting in attacker-controlled code running with the privileges of the process.", "VENDOR": ["mailenable", "mailenable$PRODUCT$mailenable"]}
