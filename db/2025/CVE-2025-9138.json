Moreover, regardless our team fixes those vulnerabilities - the overall risk change to the user due to malicious admin actions will not be lower. An admin user - by definition - has full control over HTML and JS code that is delivered to users in regular synoptic panels. In other words - due to the design of the system it is not possible to limit the admin user to attack the users.\"", "PRODUIT": ["scada-lts", "scada-lts$PRODUCT$scada-lts"]}
