It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c,\nbut not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).\n\nThis unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where\nlikely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate\nfor this was only introduced after the initial software release (which\noften serves as a baseline for products).\n\nRevert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.\n\nThis reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
