The platform allows authenticated users, with low-level member privileges, to inject arbitrary Docker Compose directives during project creation. By crafting a malicious service definition that mounts the host root filesystem, an attacker can gain full root access to the underlying server.", "VENDOR": ["coollabs", "coollabs$PRODUCT$coolify"]}
