This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Event Calendar widget's custom attributes handling and the Image Masking module's element ID rendering. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "VENDOR": []}
