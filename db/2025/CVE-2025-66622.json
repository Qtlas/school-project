Versions 0.14.1 and prior are unable to handle responses that include custom m.room.join_rules values due to a serialization bug. This can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition, if a user is invited to a room with non-standard join rules, the crate's sync process will stall, preventing further processing for all rooms. This is fixed in version 0.16.0.", "VENDOR": []}
