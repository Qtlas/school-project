This is due to missing nonce validation on the \"post_add_to_list\" function as well as an incorrect permissions callback in the \"Api/init\" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or remove products from a user's wishlist via a forged request granted they can trick a site's user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
