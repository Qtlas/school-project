This is due to missing capability checks on the Admin Tools REST endpoints which are registered with permission_callback set to __return_true. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform destructive database operations including dropping indexes on any table (including WordPress core tables like wp_options), creating duplicate configuration entries, and degrading site performance via the /wp-json/lp/v1/admin/tools/create-indexs endpoint granted they can provide table names.", "VENDOR": []}
