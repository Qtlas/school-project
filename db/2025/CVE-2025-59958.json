Also responses from the RE back to the source of this traffic could reveal confidential information about the affected device.\nThis issue only applies to firewall filters applied to WAN or revenue interfaces, so not the mgmt or lo0 interface of the routing-engine, nor any input filters.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  all versions before 22.4R3-EVO,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-EVO.", "VENDOR": []}
