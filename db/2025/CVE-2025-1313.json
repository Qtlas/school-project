This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "VENDOR": []}
