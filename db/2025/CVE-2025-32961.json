Prior to version 1.1.1, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.", "VENDOR": []}
