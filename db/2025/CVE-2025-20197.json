An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input in specific configuration commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The security impact rating (SIR) of this advisory has been raised to High because an attacker could gain access to the underlying operating system of the affected device and perform potentially undetected actions.\r\n\r Note: The attacker must have privileges to enter configuration mode on the affected device. This is usually referred to as privilege level 15.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
