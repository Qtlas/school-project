An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources.\u00a0An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is\u00a0vulnerable to\u00a0remote code execution.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$fory"]}
