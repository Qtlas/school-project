Prior to 4.0.22 and 3.4.17, a GraphQL grant on a property might be cached with different objects. The ApiPlatform\\GraphQl\\Serializer\\ItemNormalizer::isCacheKeySafe() method is meant to prevent the caching but the parent::normalize method that is called afterwards still creates the cache key and causes the issue. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.22 and 3.4.17.", "PRODUIT": ""}
