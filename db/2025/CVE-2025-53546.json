Using pull_request_target on .github/workflows/auto-fix-lint-format-commit.yml can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate GITHUB_TOKEN which has high privileges. GITHUB_TOKEN can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a.", "PRODUIT": ""}
