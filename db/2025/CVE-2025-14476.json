This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to execute arbitrary code, delete files, retrieve sensitive data, or perform other actions depending on the available gadgets. This is only exploitable by subscribers, when administrators have explicitly enabled that access.", "VENDOR": []}
