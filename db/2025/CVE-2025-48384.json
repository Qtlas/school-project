{"CVE": "CVE-2025-48384", "CWE": ["CWE-436", "CWE-59"], "DATE": "2025-07-08T19:15:42.800000+00:00", "CVSS": 8.0, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Git allows arbitrary code execution through broken config quoting", "DESC": "Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$xcode", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "git-scm", "git-scm$PRODUCT$git"]}
