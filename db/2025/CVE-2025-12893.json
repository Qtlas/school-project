A certificate that specifies extendedKeyUsage but is missing extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth may still be successfully authenticated via the TLS handshake as a server. This issue is specific to MongoDB servers running on Apple as the expected validation behavior functions correctly on both Linux and Windows systems. \n\nThis vulnerability affects MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.26, MongoDB Server v8.0 versions prior to 8.0.16 and MongoDB Server v8.2 versions prior to 8.2.2", "VENDOR": ["mongodb", "mongodb$PRODUCT$mongodb"]}
