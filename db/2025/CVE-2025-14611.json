This degrades security for public exposed endpoints that may make use of it and may offer arbitrary local file inclusion when provided a specially crafted request without authentication. This opens the door for future exploitation and can be leveraged with previous vulnerabilities to gain a full system compromise.", "PRODUIT": ["gladinet", "gladinet$PRODUCT$centrestack", "gladinet$PRODUCT$triofox"]}
