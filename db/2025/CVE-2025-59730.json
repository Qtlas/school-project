A buffer of appropriate size is allocated depending on the resolution.\n\nThis codec can encode the frame contents using a run-length encoding algorithm. There are no checks that the decoded frame fits in the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.\n\nprocess_frame_obj\u00a0initializes the buffers based on the frame resolution:\n\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.", "VENDOR": []}
