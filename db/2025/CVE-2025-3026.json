Not tested in higher versions. By modifying the \u2018Host\u2019 header in an HTTP request, it is possible to manipulate the generated links and thus redirect the client to a different base URL.  In this way, an attacker could insert his own server for the client to send HTTP requests, provided he succeeds in exploiting it.", "VENDOR": ["primekey", "primekey$PRODUCT$ejbca"]}
