The requests when crafted correctly would return specific information from user profiles (Email address/UPN and Display name) from one endpoint and group information ( Group ID and Display name) from the other. This vulnerability does not expose data within the Octopus Server product itself.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "octopus", "octopus$PRODUCT$octopus_server"]}
