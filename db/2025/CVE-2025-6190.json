The handler reads the client-supplied meta key and value pairs from $_POST and passes them directly to update_user_meta() without restricting to a safe whitelist. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the wp_capabilities meta and grant themselves the administrator role.", "VENDOR": []}
