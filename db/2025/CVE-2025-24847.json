Unprivileged software adversary with a privileged user combined with a low complexity attack may enable data exposure. This result may potentially occur via network access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge and requires passive user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (none) and availability (none) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.", "PRODUIT": "intel"}
