To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have root-system privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient verification of modules in the software load process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the loaded binaries to bypass some of the integrity checks that are performed during the booting process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to control the boot configuration, which could enable them to bypass the requirement to run Cisco-signed images or alter the security properties of the running system.\r\nNote: This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software, not the Secure Boot feature.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
