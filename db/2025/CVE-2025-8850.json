The system allows users to disable 2FA without requiring a valid OTP or backup code, bypassing the intended verification process. This vulnerability occurs because the backend does not properly validate the OTP or backup code when the API endpoint '/api/auth/2fa/disable' is directly accessed. This flaw can be exploited by authenticated users to weaken the security of their own accounts, although it does not lead to full account compromise.", "VENDOR": ["librechat", "librechat$PRODUCT$librechat"]}
