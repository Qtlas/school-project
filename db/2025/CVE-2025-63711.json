The application's user deletion endpoint (e.g., superadmin_user_delete.php) accepts POST requests containing a user_id parameter and does not enforce request origin or anti-CSRF tokens. Because the endpoint lacks proper authentication/authorization checks and CSRF protections, a remote attacker can craft a malicious page that triggers deletion when visited by an authenticated admin, resulting in arbitrary removal of user accounts.", "VENDOR": ["lerouxyxchire", "lerouxyxchire$PRODUCT$client_database_management_system"]}
