{"CVE": "CVE-2025-13685", "CWE": ["CWE-352"], "DATE": "2025-12-02T07:15:48", "CVSS": 4.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Photo Gallery by Ays <= 6.4.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Bulk Actions", "DESC": "The Photo Gallery by Ays plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8. This is due to missing nonce verification on the bulk action functionality in the 'process_bulk_action()' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk operations (delete, publish, or unpublish galleries) via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
