Unfortunately, op->max_freq is not valid\nwhen this function is called during probe but is instead zero.\nAccordingly, baud_rate_val is calculated to be INT_MAX due to division\nby zero, causing probe of the attached memory device to fail.\n\nSeemingly spi-microchip-core-qspi was the only driver that had such a\nmodification made to its supports_op callback when the per_op_freq\ncapability was added, so just remove it to restore prior functionality.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
