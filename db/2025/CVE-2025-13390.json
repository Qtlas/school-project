This is due to the feature using a cryptographically weak token generation mechanism. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative access and achieve full site takeover via the auto-login endpoint with a predictable token.", "VENDOR": ["wpdirectorykit", "wpdirectorykit$PRODUCT$wp_directory_kit"]}
