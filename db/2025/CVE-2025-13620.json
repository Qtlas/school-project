This is due to the REST routes wslu/v1/check_cache/{type}, wslu/v1/save_cache/{type}, and wslu/v1/settings/clear_counter_cache being registered with permission_callback set to __return_true and lacking capability or nonce validation in their handlers. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear or overwrite the social counter cache via crafted REST requests.", "VENDOR": []}
