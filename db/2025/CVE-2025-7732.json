The plugin\u2019s JavaScript registration handlers read the client\u2011supplied 'data-video-title' and 'href' attributes, decode HTML entities by default, and pass them directly into DOM sinks without any escaping or validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "VENDOR": []}
