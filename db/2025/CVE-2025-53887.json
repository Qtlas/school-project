Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication.

Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.", "PRODUIT": ["monospace", "monospace$PRODUCT$directus"]}
