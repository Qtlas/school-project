These handlers return from\nthe respective function and calculate the remaining bytes left to copy\nusing the current register contents. This commit fixes a couple of bad\ncalculations and a broken epilogue in the exception handlers. This will\nprevent crashes and ensure correct return values of copy_from_user and\ncopy_to_user in the faulting case. The behaviour of memcpy stays unchanged.", "PRODUIT": ""}
