I haven't further investigated whether this can be\nchanged or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization\nbetween these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect much\nboot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
