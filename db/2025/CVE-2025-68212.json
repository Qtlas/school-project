However, the\nSTATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the\nstruct fields instead of using offp. This leaves offp uninitialized,\nleading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.\n\nFix it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code\npath consistent.", "VENDOR": []}
