The hardware status, indicating a header or\npayload checksum failure, was being ignored at this stage. This could\ncause corrupt packets to be passed up the network stack as valid.\n\nThis patch corrects the logic by checking the `csum_none` status flag,\nwhich is set when the hardware reports a checksum error. If this flag\nis set, skb->ip_summed is now correctly set to CHECKSUM_NONE,\nensuring the kernel's network stack will perform its own validation and\nproperly handle the corrupt packet.", "VENDOR": []}
