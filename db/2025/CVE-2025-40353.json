However, following commit 060913999d7a (\"mm: migrate:\nsupport poisoned recover from migrate folio\"), folio_mc_copy() is called\nbefore __folio_migrate_mapping(). If the latter fails (-EAGAIN), the\ncopy will be done again to the same destination page. Since\ncopy_highpage() already set the PG_mte_tagged flag, this second copy\nwill warn.\n\nReplace the WARN_ON_ONCE(page already tagged) in the arm64\ncopy_highpage() with a comment.", "VENDOR": []}
