An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would then be executed in a restricted container with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Observer.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_center"]}
