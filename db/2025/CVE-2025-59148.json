Versions 8.0.0 and below incorrectly handle the entropy keyword when not anchored to a \"sticky\" buffer, which can lead to a segmentation fault. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules using the entropy keyword, or validate they are anchored to a sticky buffer.", "PRODUIT": "oisf"}
