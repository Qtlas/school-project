This flaw involves an 'off-by-one' miscalculation when handling prefixes and suffixes for file names. This can lead to a 1-byte write overflow. While seemingly small, such an overflow can corrupt adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or in specific circumstances, could be leveraged as a building block for more sophisticated exploitation. This bug affects libarchive versions prior to 3.8.0.", "PRODUIT": ["libarchive", "libarchive$PRODUCT$libarchive", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform"]}
