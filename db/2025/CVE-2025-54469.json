When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks \nwhether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the \nmonitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.\n\n\nThe values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT\n are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without \nvalidation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user \nto inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer\n container.", "VENDOR": []}
