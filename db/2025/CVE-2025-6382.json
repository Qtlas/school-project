The plugin\u2019s render() method takes the user-supplied name attribute and injects it directly into a <script> tag - both in the id attribute and inside jQuery.getScript() - without proper escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "VENDOR": []}
