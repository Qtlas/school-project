This is due to missing capability checks and nonce verification on functions hooked to 'init'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate the plugin, tamper with OAuth configuration, and trigger test connections that expose sensitive data via direct request to vulnerable endpoints granted they can craft malicious requests with specific parameters.", "VENDOR": []}
