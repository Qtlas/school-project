In versions prior to 2.5.3 and 2.2.15, `Deno.FsFile.prototype.utime` and `Deno.FsFile.prototype.utimeSync` are not limited by the permission model check `--deny-write=./`. It's possible to change to change the access (`atime`) and modification (`mtime`) times on the file stream resource even when the file is opened with `read` only permission (and `write`: `false`) and file write operations are not allowed (the script is executed with `--deny-write=./`). Similar APIs like `Deno.utime` and `Deno.utimeSync` require\u00a0`allow-write`\u00a0permission, however, when a file is opened, even with read only flags and deny-write permission, it's still possible to change the access (`atime`) and modification (`mtime`) times, and thus bypass the permission model. Versions 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 fix the issue.", "VENDOR": ["deno", "deno$PRODUCT$deno"]}
