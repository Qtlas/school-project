When an authenticated user omits or leaves the `password` and `repeat_password` parameters empty in the password change request, the backend still returns a successful response and sets the password to an empty string. This effectively disables authentication and may allow unauthorized access to user or administrative accounts.", "VENDOR": ["opensourcepos", "opensourcepos$PRODUCT$open_source_point_of_sale"]}
