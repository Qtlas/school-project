The plugin registers the /webhook/v2/order_info/ route with a permission_callback that always returns true, effectively bypassing all authentication. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know any user\u2019s email to obtain a valid login cookie and fully impersonate that account.", "VENDOR": []}
