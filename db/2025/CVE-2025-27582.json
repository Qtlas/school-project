The issue arises from a flawed security hardening mechanism within the kiosk browser used to display the Password Self-Service site to end users. Specifically, the application attempts to restrict privileged actions by overriding the native window.print() function. However, this protection can be bypassed by an attacker who accesses the Password Self-Service site from the lock screen and navigates to an attacker-controlled webpage via the Help function. By hosting a crafted web page with JavaScript, the attacker can restore and invoke the window.print() function, launching a SYSTEM-privileged print dialog. From this dialog, the attacker can exploit standard Windows functionality - such as the Print to PDF or Add Printer wizard - to spawn a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation allows a local attacker (with access to a locked workstation) to gain SYSTEM-level privileges, granting full control over the affected device.", "VENDOR": []}
