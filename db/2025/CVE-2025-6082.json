{"CVE": "CVE-2025-6082", "CWE": ["CWE-200"], "DATE": "2025-07-22T10:15:25.443000+00:00", "CVSS": 5.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "Birth Chart Compatibility <= 2.0 - Unauthenticated Full Path Exposure", "DESC": "The Birth Chart Compatibility plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to insufficient protection against directly accessing the plugin's index.php file, which causes an error exposing the full path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.", "VENDOR": []}
