This stored XSS payload is executed whenever another admin views the firewall rules page, enabling session hijacking, unauthorized actions within the interface, or further internal pivoting. Exploitation requires only high-privilege GUI access, and the complexity of the attack is low.", "VENDOR": ["ipfire", "ipfire$PRODUCT$ipfire"]}
