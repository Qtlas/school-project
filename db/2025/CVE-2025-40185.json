This causes subsequent insertions at\nthe same index to return -EBUSY, potentially leading to\nNULL pointer dereferences.\n\nReorder the operations as suggested by Przemek Kitszel:\n1. Check if adapter already exists (xa_load)\n2. Reserve the XArray slot (xa_reserve)\n3. Allocate the adapter (ice_adapter_new)\n4. Store the adapter (xa_store)", "VENDOR": []}
