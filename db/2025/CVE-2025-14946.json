A malicious actor could exploit this by convincing libnbd to open a specially crafted Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This vulnerability arises because non-standard hostnames starting with '-o' are incorrectly interpreted as arguments to the Secure Shell (SSH) process, rather than as hostnames. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running libnbd.", "VENDOR": []}
