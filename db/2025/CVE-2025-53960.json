An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform offline brute-force attacks on the user's password using a captured JWT, or to arbitrarily forge identity tokens for the user if the password is already known, ultimately leading to complete account takeover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before 2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue.", "PRODUIT": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$streampark"]}
