The Windows client ships the CA certificate and its associated private key (and other sensitive settings such as a configured password) directly in shipped configuration files (for example clientsettings.dat and defaults.ini). An attacker who obtains these files can impersonate the CA, sign arbitrary certificates trusted by the Windows client, intercept or decrypt TLS-protected communications, and otherwise perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks against the product's network communications.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2022-001 \u2014 Configuration File Contains CA & Private Key.", "PRODUIT": "microsoft"}
