{"CVE": "CVE-2025-34067", "CWE": ["CWE-502"], "DATE": "2025-07-02T14:15:24", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Hikvision Integrated Security Management Platform Remote Command Execution via applyCT Fastjson", "DESC": "An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in the applyCT component of the Hikvision Integrated Security Management Platform due to the use of a vulnerable version of the Fastjson library. The endpoint /bic/ssoService/v1/applyCT deserializes untrusted user input, allowing an attacker to trigger Fastjson's auto-type feature to load arbitrary Java classes. By referencing a malicious class via an LDAP URL, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the underlying system. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-02-05 UTC.", "VENDOR": []}
