Versions 1.6.4 and below use function GenerateRandomPassword() to create passwords using PHP's rand(). rand() is not cryptographically secure, which allows password sequences to be predicted or brute-forced. This can lead to user account compromise or privilege escalation if these passwords are used for new accounts or password resets. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.6.5.", "PRODUIT": ["wbce", "wbce$PRODUCT$wbce_cms"]}
