This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as chart categories, titles, and tooltip settings. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "VENDOR": []}
