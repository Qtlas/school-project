XOR starts at sizeof(struct batadv_unicast_packet), reducing\npayload headroom, and the source skb length is not verified, allowing an\nout-of-bounds read and a small out-of-bounds write.\n\nValidate that coded_len fits within the payload area of both destination\nand source sk_buffs before XORing.", "VENDOR": []}
