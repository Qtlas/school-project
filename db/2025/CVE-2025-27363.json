The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "freetype", "freetype$PRODUCT$freetype"]}
