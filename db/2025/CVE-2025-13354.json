This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the \"taxopress_merge_terms_batch\" function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to merge or delete arbitrary taxonomy terms.", "PRODUIT": ["taxopress", "taxopress$PRODUCT$taxopress"]}
