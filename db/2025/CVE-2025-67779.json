React Server Components versions 19.0.2, 19.1.3 and 19.2.2 are affected, allowing unsafe deserialization of payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints. This can cause an infinite loop that hangs the server process and may prevent future HTTP requests from being served.", "VENDOR": ["facebook", "facebook$PRODUCT$react", "vercel", "vercel$PRODUCT$next.js"]}
