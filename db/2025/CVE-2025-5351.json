The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.", "VENDOR": ["libssh", "libssh$PRODUCT$libssh", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform"]}
