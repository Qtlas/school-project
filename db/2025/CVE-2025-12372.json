This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the handleTPCAdminAjaxRequest function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform unauthorized administrative actions such as enabling or disabling automatic pinging settings and modifying page exclusion settings.", "VENDOR": []}
