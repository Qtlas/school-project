This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the user supplied `width` and `height` shortcode attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "VENDOR": []}
