{"CVE": "CVE-2025-25300", "CWE": ["CWE-601", "CWE-79"], "DATE": "2025-02-18 18:15:35", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "smartbanner.js rel noopener XSS vulnerability", "DESC": "smartbanner.js is a customizable smart app banner for iOS and Android. Prior to version 1.14.1, clicking on smartbanner `View` link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile third parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner. `rel=\"noopener\"` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability. Some workarounds are available for those who cannot upgrade. Ensure `View` link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams. If `View` link is going to a third party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel=\"noopener\"` is imposed on all `target=\"_blank\"` links. Version 1.14.1 of smartbanner.js contains a fix for the issue.", "PRODUIT": ""}
