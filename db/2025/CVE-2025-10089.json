However, if the signer name \"Mitsubishi Electric Lighting\" appears on the \"Digital Signatures\" tab of the properties for \"MILCO.S Lighting Control.exe\", the application is a fixed one. This vulnerability only affects when the installer is run, not after installation. If a user downloads directly from Mitsubishi Electric website and installs the affected product, there is no risk of malicious code being introduced.", "VENDOR": []}
