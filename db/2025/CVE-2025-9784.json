This issue, referred to as the \"MadeYouReset\" attack, allows malicious clients to induce excessive server workload by repeatedly causing server-side stream aborts. While not a protocol bug, this highlights a common implementation weakness that can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS).", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$build_of_apache_camel_for_spring_boot", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$fuse", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_enterprise_application_platform", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_enterprise_application_platform_expansion_pack", "redhat$PRODUCT$process_automation", "redhat$PRODUCT$single_sign-on", "redhat$PRODUCT$undertow"]}
