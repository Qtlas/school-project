Starting in version 0.23.0 and prior to version 0.29.5, SBOM files generated by melange in apks had file system permissions mode 666. This potentially allows an unprivileged user to tamper with apk SBOMs on a running image, potentially confusing security scanners. An attacker could also perform a DoS under special circumstances. Version 0.29.5 fixes the issue.", "VENDOR": []}
