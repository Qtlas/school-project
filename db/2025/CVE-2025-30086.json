The q URL parameter allows a user to filter users by any column, and filter password=~ could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character by character. An attacker with administrator access could exploit this to leak highly sensitive information stored in the Harbor database. All endpoints that support the q URL parameter are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack.", "VENDOR": []}
