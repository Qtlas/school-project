When the victim logs in, the application continues to use the attacker-supplied session ID rather than generating a new one, enabling the attacker to hijack the authenticated session and gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.", "VENDOR": ["shridharshukl", "shridharshukl$PRODUCT$blood_bank_management_system"]}
