This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied URLs, which allows javascript: URI schemes to be embedded in the reject_url parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user clicks the \"No, I do not approve of this connection\" button, granted they can successfully trick the victim into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
