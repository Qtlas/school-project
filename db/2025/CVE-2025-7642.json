This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in as an admin through the simplerwc_woocommerce_order_created() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users based on their order ID, which can be an administrator if a site admin has placed a test order.", "VENDOR": []}
