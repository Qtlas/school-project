This is due to the plugin's REST API endpoint accepting arbitrary absolute file paths without proper validation in the 'attach_file()' function when handling 'file_local' actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, including sensitive configuration files and system files via the 'local_url' parameter.", "PRODUIT": ""}
