This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password and email through the edit_profile_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses and passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "PRODUIT": "iqonic"}
