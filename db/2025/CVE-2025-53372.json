Prior to 1.3.0, a command injection vulnerability exists in the node-code-sandbox-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.execSync, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges on the host machine, bypassing the sandbox protection of running code inside docker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.3.0.", "VENDOR": []}
