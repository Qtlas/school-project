This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled forwarded headers (such as CF-Connecting-IP, X-Forwarded-For, and others) without verifying that those headers originate from legitimate, trusted proxies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their IP address and bypass IP-based security controls, including blocked IP lists and rate limiting protections, by sending arbitrary HTTP headers with their requests.", "VENDOR": []}
