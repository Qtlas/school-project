{"CVE": "CVE-2025-61689", "CWE": ["CWE-113"], "DATE": "2025-10-10T17:15:39.367000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "HTTP.jl vulnerable to Header injection/Response splitting via header construction.", "DESC": "HTTP.jl is an HTTP client and server functionality for the Julia programming language. Prior to version 1.10.19, HTTP.jl did not validate header names/values for illegal characters, allowing CRLF-based header injection and response splitting. This enables HTTP response splitting and header injection, leading to cache poisoning, XSS, session fixation, and more. This issue is fixed in HTTP.jl  `v1.10.19`.", "VENDOR": []}
