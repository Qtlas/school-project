Authentication failure messages differ based on whether a supplied username exists or not, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to infer valid account identifiers. This can facilitate user enumeration and increase the likelihood of targeted brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.", "VENDOR": []}
