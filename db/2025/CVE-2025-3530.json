This is due to a logic flaw involving the inconsistent use of parameters during the cart addition process. The plugin uses the parameter 'product_tmp_two' for computing a security hash against price tampering while using 'wspsc_product' to display the product, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to substitute details from a cheaper product and bypass payment for a more expensive item.", "VENDOR": []}
