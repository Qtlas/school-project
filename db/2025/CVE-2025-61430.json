This happens when the TCP length prefix is malformed (len differs from actual packet len), and due to a concurrency/buffering issue, even when the lengths match. A length prefix that is smaller than the actual packet size increases information leakage. In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to see DNS queries of other clients.", "PRODUIT": ""}
