Prior to version 1.0.0, a critical vulnerability exists in the `llamafy_baichuan2.py` script of the LLaMA-Factory project. The script performs insecure deserialization using `torch.load()` on user-supplied `.bin` files from an input directory. An attacker can exploit this behavior by crafting a malicious `.bin` file that executes arbitrary commands during deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.0.", "VENDOR": ["hiyouga", "hiyouga$PRODUCT$llama-factory"]}
