However if\nCONFIG_BUG is disabled, which is an uncommon and exotic scenario, then\nwe fallthrough and call cache_state() which will dereference the error\npointer, resulting in an invalid memory access.\n\nSo jump to the 'out' label after calling extent_io_tree_panic(), it also\nmakes the code more clear besides dealing with the exotic scenario where\nCONFIG_BUG is disabled.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
