This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized before the `ninja-forms-views` REST endpoints return form metadata and submission content. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary form definitions and submission records via a leaked bearer token granted they can load any page containing the Submissions Table block. NOTE: The developer released a patch for this issue in 3.13.1, but inadvertently introduced a REST API endpoint in which a valid bearer token could be minted for arbitrary form IDs, making this patch ineffective.", "VENDOR": ["ninjaforms", "ninjaforms$PRODUCT$ninja_forms"]}
