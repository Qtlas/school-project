This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within multiple block components including Google Maps markers, Lightbox captions, Image Gallery data attributes, Progress Pie prefix/suffix fields, and Text Path URL fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "VENDOR": []}
