When processing elements with non-standard CSS color values, the library fails to validate the result of a regular expression match before accessing its properties, leading to an uncaught TypeError and potential application crash. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because there is no common scenario in which an adversary can insert those non-standard values.", "VENDOR": []}
