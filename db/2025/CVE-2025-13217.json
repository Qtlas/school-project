This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied YouTube video URLs in the `um_profile_field_filter_hook__youtube_video()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute whenever a user accesses the injected user's profile page.", "PRODUIT": ""}
