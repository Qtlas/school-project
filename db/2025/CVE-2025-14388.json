{"CVE": "CVE-2025-14388", "CWE": ["CWE-158"], "DATE": "2025-12-23T10:15:43.673000+00:00", "CVSS": 9.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "PhastPress <= 3.7 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read via Null Byte Injection", "DESC": "The PhastPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read via null byte injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.7. This is due to a discrepancy between the extension validation in `getExtensionForURL()` which operates on URL-decoded paths, and `appendNormalized()` which strips everything after a null byte before constructing the filesystem path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the webroot, including wp-config.php, by appending a double URL-encoded null byte (%2500) followed by an allowed extension (.txt) to the file path.", "VENDOR": []}
