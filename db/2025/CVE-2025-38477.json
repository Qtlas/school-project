For example, qfq_dump_class may trigger a NULL\ndereference, and qfq_delete_class may cause a use-after-free.\n\nThis patch addresses the issue by:\n\n1. Moved qfq_destroy_class into the critical section.\n\n2. Added sch_tree_lock protection to qfq_dump_class and\nqfq_dump_class_stats.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
