Prior to versions 14.2.32 and 15.4.7, when next() was used without explicitly passing the request object, it could lead to SSRF in self-hosted applications that incorrectly forwarded user-supplied headers. This vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js versions 14.2.32 and 15.4.7. All users implementing custom middleware logic in self-hosted environments are strongly encouraged to upgrade and verify correct usage of the next() function.", "VENDOR": ["vercel", "vercel$PRODUCT$next.js"]}
