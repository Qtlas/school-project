Specifically, this patch adds incrementing\nand decrementing of rose_neigh->use when rose_neigh->count is incremented\nor decremented.\n\nThis patch also modifies rose_rt_free(), rose_rt_device_down() and\nrose_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh objects\nbefore freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().\n\nThese changes ensure rose_neigh structures are properly freed only when\nall references, including those from rose_node structures, are released.\nAs a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot.", "VENDOR": []}
