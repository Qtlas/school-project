The vulnerability is accessible via multiple localized subpaths such as '/eng/', '/chs/', or '/cht/', where the 'js/lang_en_us.js' or equivalent files are loaded. By injecting encoded traversal sequences such as '%c0%ae%c0%ae' into the request path, attackers can bypass input validation and disclose sensitive files.", "VENDOR": []}
