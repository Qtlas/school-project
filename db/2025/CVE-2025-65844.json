The endpoint is accessible without authentication by default, and server-side validation of uploaded files is insufficient. This can be abused to upload arbitrary content (including non-image files) which could impersonate user/admin login panels (exfiltrating credentials) and to perform a denial-of-service attack by exhausting disk space.", "VENDOR": ["evershop", "evershop$PRODUCT$evershop"]}
