Communication between the microcontroller and the secure element transmits credentials in plain. This allows an adversary to eavesdrop the communication and derive the secrets stored in the microcontroller. As a result, the attacker is able to arbitrarily manipulate the firmware of the microcontroller.", "VENDOR": ["nitrokey", "nitrokey$PRODUCT$fido_u2f", "nitrokey$PRODUCT$fido_u2f_firmware"]}
