In go-ipfs before version 0.8.0-rc1, it is possible for path traversal to occur with DAGs containing relative paths during retrieval. This can cause files to be overwritten, or written to incorrect output directories. The issue can only occur when a get is done on an affected DAG. This is fixed in version 0.8.0-rc1.", "VENDOR": ["protocol", "protocol$PRODUCT$go-ipfs"]}
