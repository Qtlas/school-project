These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800_embedded_wireless_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
