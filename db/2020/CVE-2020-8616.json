This has at least two potential effects: The performance of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "isc", "isc$PRODUCT$bind"]}
