The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request over an SSL connection to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340w_dual_wan_gigabit_wireless-ac_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340w_dual_wan_gigabit_wireless-ac_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345p_dual_wan_gigabit_poe_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345p_dual_wan_gigabit_poe_vpn_router_firmware"]}
