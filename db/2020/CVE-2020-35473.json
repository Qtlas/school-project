RPAs that have been associated with a specific remote device may also be used to identify a peer in the same manner by using its reaction to an active scan request. This has also been called an allowlist-based side channel.", "VENDOR": ["bluetooth", "bluetooth$PRODUCT$bluetooth_core_specification"]}
