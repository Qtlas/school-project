The vulnerability is due to improper input validation for certain fields of specific SSL/TLS messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SSL/TLS message through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after it has reloaded.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2110", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2130", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
