The allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code and can lead to remote code execution. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to at least one `Extbase` plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation. This is fixed in version 7.6.5 of the \"mediace\" extension for TYPO3.", "PRODUIT": "typo3"}
