The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the IP addresses that are configured on the internal interfaces of the affected device. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asyncos", "cisco$PRODUCT$email_security_appliance"]}
