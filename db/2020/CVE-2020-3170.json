The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the HTTP header of a request that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the NX-API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the NX-API service; however, the Cisco NX-OS device itself would still be available and passing network traffic. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9132t", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9148s", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9148t", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9216", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9216a", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9216i", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9222i", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9506", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9509", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9513", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9706", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9710", "cisco$PRODUCT$mds_9718", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_7000", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_7700", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os"]}
