The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted arguments to specific commands on the local management CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS with the privileges of the currently logged-in user for all affected platforms excluding Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects. On Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, the injected commands are executed with root privileges.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6248up", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6296up", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6324", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6332", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6332-16up", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_64108", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6454", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_manager"]}
