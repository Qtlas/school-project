This is the case for both authenticated and unauthenticated pairing with both LE Secure Connections as well as LE Legacy Pairing. A predictable or brute-forceable random number allows an attacker (in radio range) to perform a MITM attack during BLE pairing.", "VENDOR": ["cypress", "cypress$PRODUCT$psoc_4.2_ble"]}
