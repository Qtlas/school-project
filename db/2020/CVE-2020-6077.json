When parsing mDNS messages, the implementation does not properly keep track of the available data in the message, possibly leading to an out-of-bounds read that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "videolabs", "videolabs$PRODUCT$libmicrodns"]}
