An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI handles objects in memory and by preventing instances of unintended user-mode privilege elevation.\n", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019"]}
