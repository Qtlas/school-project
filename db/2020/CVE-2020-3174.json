The ARP entries are for nonlocal IP addresses for the subnet. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of a received gratuitous ARP (GARP) request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious GARP packet on the local subnet to cause the ARP table on the device to become corrupted. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to populate the ARP table with incorrect entries, which could lead to traffic disruptions.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
