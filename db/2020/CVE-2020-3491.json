The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative privileges on the affected device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$vision_dynamic_signage_director"]}
