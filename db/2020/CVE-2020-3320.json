The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first entering input within the web-based management interface and then persuading a user of the interface to view the crafted input within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_management_center", "cisco$PRODUCT$sourcefire_defense_center"]}
