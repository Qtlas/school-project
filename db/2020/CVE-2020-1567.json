If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nIn a HTML editing attack scenario, an attacker could trick a user into editing a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how MSHTML engine validates input.\n", "PRODUIT": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$internet_explorer", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_7", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_8.1", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_rt_8.1", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2008", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2012", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019"]}
