This could cause legitimate traffic to be discarded, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects Junos OS 17.4 and later releases. Prior releases do not support this feature and are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue only affects IPv6. IPv4 ARP proxy is unaffected by this vulnerability.
