This requires the victim to be tricked into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form. A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the victim, e.g. creating and modifying user accounts, changing system configuration settings and cause DoS conditions. Note: For Bosch PRAESIDEO 4.31 and newer and Bosch PRAESENSA in all versions, the confidentiality impact is considered low because user credentials are not shown in the web interface.", "VENDOR": ["bosch", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesensa", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesensa_firmware", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesideo", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesideo_firmware"]}
