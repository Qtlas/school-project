Such a service is generally thought to be reachable only by other processes on the same host, but due to this defeect, could be reachable by other hosts on the same LAN as the node, or by containers running on the same node as the service.", "VENDOR": ["kubernetes", "kubernetes$PRODUCT$kubernetes"]}
