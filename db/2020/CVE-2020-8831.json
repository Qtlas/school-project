{"CVE": "CVE-2020-8831", "CWE": ["CWE-379", "CWE-59"], "DATE": "2020-04-22 22:15:12", "SCORE": 6.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "TITLE": "World writable root owned lock file created in user controllable location", "DESC": "Apport creates a world writable lock file with root ownership in the world writable /var/lock/apport directory. If the apport/ directory does not exist (this is not uncommon as /var/lock is a tmpfs), it will create the directory, otherwise it will simply continue execution using the existing directory. This allows for a symlink attack if an attacker were to create a symlink at /var/lock/apport, changing apport's lock file location. This file could then be used to escalate privileges, for example. Fixed in versions 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.23, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.14, 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.8 and 2.20.11-0ubuntu22.", "PRODUIT": ["apport_project", "apport_project$PRODUCT$apport", "canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux"]}
