The vulnerability exists because the web management software does not properly handle RBAC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and delete certain screen content on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to access.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$vision_dynamic_signage_director"]}
