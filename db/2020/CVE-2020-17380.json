It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA transfer via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the host.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu"]}
