Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files. This could lead to a stack based buffer overflow while trying to copy to a buffer during font string handling. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.", "VENDOR": ["siemens", "siemens$PRODUCT$jt2go", "siemens$PRODUCT$teamcenter_visualization"]}
