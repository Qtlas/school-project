These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties\". Hydra does not check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat difficult because: - TLS protects against MITM which makes it difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay attacks - The expiry time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it could be replayed This has been patched in version v1.4.0+oryOS.17", "PRODUIT": ["ory", "ory$PRODUCT$hydra"]}
