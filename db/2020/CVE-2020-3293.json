The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a stack overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_firmware"]}
