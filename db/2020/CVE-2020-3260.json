The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of client packets that are sent to an affected access point (AP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of sustained client packets to the affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected AP to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1542d", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1542d_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1542i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1542i_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1815", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1815_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1830", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1830_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1840", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1840_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1850", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1850_firmware"]}
