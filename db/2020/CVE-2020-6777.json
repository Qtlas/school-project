When the victim logs into the management interface, the stored script code is executed in the context of his browser. A successful exploit would allow an attacker to interact with the management interface with the privileges of the victim. However, as the attacker already needs admin privileges, there is no additional impact on the management interface itself.", "PRODUIT": ["bosch", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesensa", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesensa_firmware", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesideo", "bosch$PRODUCT$praesideo_firmware"]}
