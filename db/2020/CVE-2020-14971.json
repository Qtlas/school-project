This occurs in settings.php. To exploit this, an attacker would request a backup of limited files via teleporter.php. These are placed into a .tar.gz archive. The attacker then modifies the host parameter in dnsmasq.d files, and then compresses and uploads these files again.", "VENDOR": ["pi-hole", "pi-hole$PRODUCT$pi-hole"]}
