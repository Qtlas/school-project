{"CVE": "CVE-2020-11934", "CWE": ["CWE-668"], "DATE": "2020-07-29 17:15:12", "SCORE": 5.9, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "TITLE": "Sandbox escape vulnerability via snapctl user-open (xdg-open)", "DESC": "It was discovered that snapctl user-open allowed altering the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable when calling the system xdg-open. OpenURL() in usersession/userd/launcher.go would alter $XDG_DATA_DIRS to append a path to a directory controlled by the calling snap. A malicious snap could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions to control how the host system xdg-open script opens the URL and, for example, execute a script shipped with the snap without confinement. This issue did not affect Ubuntu Core systems. Fixed in snapd versions 2.45.1ubuntu0.2, 2.45.1+18.04.2 and 2.45.1+20.04.2.", "PRODUIT": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux"]}
