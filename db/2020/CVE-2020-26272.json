In versions of Electron IPC prior to 9.4.0, 10.2.0, 11.1.0, and 12.0.0-beta.9, messages sent from the main process to a subframe in the renderer process, through webContents.sendToFrame, event.reply or when using the remote module, can in some cases be delivered to the wrong frame. If your app uses remote, calls webContents.sendToFrame, or calls event.reply in an IPC message handler then it is impacted by this issue. This has been fixed in versions 9.4.0, 10.2.0, 11.1.0, and 12.0.0-beta.9. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "VENDOR": ["electronjs", "electronjs$PRODUCT$electron"]}
