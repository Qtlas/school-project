The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w_wireless-n_vpn_firewall", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w_wireless-n_vpn_firewall_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w_firmware"]}
