An attacker with access to a web console account may execute operating system commands on affected devices by sending crafted POST requests to the affected endpoints (/core/api/calls/Throughput.php, /core/api/calls/WANStats.php, /core/api/calls/PhyStats.php, /core/api/calls/QosStats.php). This results in the complete takeover of the vulnerable device. This vulnerability does not occur in the older 1.5.x firmware versions.", "VENDOR": ["mimosa", "mimosa$PRODUCT$b5", "mimosa$PRODUCT$b5_firmware", "mimosa$PRODUCT$b5c", "mimosa$PRODUCT$b5c_firmware", "mimosa$PRODUCT$c5c", "mimosa$PRODUCT$c5c_firmware"]}
