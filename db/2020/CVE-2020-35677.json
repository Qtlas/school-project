The caveat here is that an attacker would need administrative privileges in order to create the payload. One might think this completely mitigates the privilege-escalation impact as there is only one high-privileged role. However, it was discovered that the endpoint responsible for creating the group lacks CSRF protection.", "VENDOR": ["bigprof", "bigprof$PRODUCT$online_invoicing_system"]}
