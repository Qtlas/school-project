It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. The remotely callable methods from remotable objects available through interprocess communication allow loading of arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins\u201d directory, where the name of the plugin is passed as part of an XML-serialized object. However, because the name of the DLL is concatenated with the \u201c.\\plugins\u201d string, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in the way plugins are resolved.", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "riverbed", "riverbed$PRODUCT$steelcentral_aternity_agent"]}
