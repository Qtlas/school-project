The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation when the affected software processes certain OSPFv2 packets with Link-Local Signaling (LLS) data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPFv2 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
