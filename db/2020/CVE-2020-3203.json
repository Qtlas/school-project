The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain public key infrastructure (PKI) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory, which could result in a memory allocation failure that leads to a crash and causes a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
