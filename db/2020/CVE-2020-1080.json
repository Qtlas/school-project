An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain elevated privileges on a target operating system.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run.  However, this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or more vulnerabilities (e.g. a remote code execution vulnerability and another elevation of privilege) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows Hyper-V handles objects in memory.</p>\n", "PRODUIT": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019"]}
