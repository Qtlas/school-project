This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "json_project", "json_project$PRODUCT$json", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "ruby-lang", "ruby-lang$PRODUCT$ruby"]}
