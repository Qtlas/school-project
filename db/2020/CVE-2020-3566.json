The vulnerability is due to insufficient queue management for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion, resulting in instability of other processes. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols. Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9001", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9010", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9901", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9904", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9906", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9910", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9912", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9922", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr"]}
