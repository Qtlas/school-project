For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.", "VENDOR": ["node-fetch_project", "node-fetch_project$PRODUCT$node-fetch"]}
