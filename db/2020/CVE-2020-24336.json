The code for parsing Type A domain name answers in ip64-dns64.c doesn't verify whether the address in the answer's length is sane. Therefore, when copying an address of an arbitrary length, a buffer overflow can occur. This bug can be exploited whenever NAT64 is enabled.", "VENDOR": ["contiki-ng", "contiki-ng$PRODUCT$contiki-ng", "contiki-os", "contiki-os$PRODUCT$contiki"]}
