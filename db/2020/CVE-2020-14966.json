It allows a malleability in ECDSA signatures by not checking overflows in the length of a sequence and '0' characters appended or prepended to an integer. The modified signatures are verified as valid. This could have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.", "PRODUIT": ["jsrsasign_project", "jsrsasign_project$PRODUCT$jsrsasign", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$max_data"]}
