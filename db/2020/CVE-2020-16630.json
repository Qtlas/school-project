A LTK can be an unauthenticated-and-no-MITM-protection key created by Just Works or an authenticated-and-MITM-protection key created by Passkey Entry, Numeric Comparison or OOB. Assume that a victim mobile uses secure pairing to pair with a victim BLE device based on TI chips and generate an authenticated-and-MITM-protection LTK. If a fake mobile with the victim mobile\u2019s MAC address uses Just Works and pairs with the victim device, the generated LTK still has the property of authenticated-and-MITM-protection. Therefore, the fake mobile can access attributes with the authenticated read/write permission.", "VENDOR": ["ti", "ti$PRODUCT$15.4-stack", "ti$PRODUCT$ble5-stack", "ti$PRODUCT$dynamic_multi-protocal_manager", "ti$PRODUCT$easylink", "ti$PRODUCT$openthread", "ti$PRODUCT$real-time_operating_system", "ti$PRODUCT$z-stack"]}
