These could be triggered by an extremely large number of arguments to the initrd command on 32-bit architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on any architecture. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.", "PRODUIT": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$grub2", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_8.1", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_rt_8.1", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2012", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_atomic_host", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform", "suse", "suse$PRODUCT$suse_linux_enterprise_server"]}
