This occurs in the remove_hf function in the Kamailio textops module. Particular use of remove_hf in Sippy Softswitch may allow skilled attacker having a valid credential in the system to disrupt internal call start/duration accounting mechanisms leading potentially to a loss of revenue.", "VENDOR": ["kamailio", "kamailio$PRODUCT$kamailio"]}
