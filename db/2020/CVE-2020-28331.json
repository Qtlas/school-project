Affected Version(s): 2.5.1.8. The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W device has an SSH daemon included in the firmware image. By default, the SSH daemon is disabled and does not start at system boot. The system initialization scripts read a device configuration file variable to see if the SSH daemon should be started. The web interface does not provide a visible capability to alter this configuration file variable. However, a malicious actor can include this variable in a POST such that the SSH daemon will be started when the device boots.", "PRODUIT": ["barco", "barco$PRODUCT$wepresent_wipg-1600w", "barco$PRODUCT$wepresent_wipg-1600w_firmware"]}
