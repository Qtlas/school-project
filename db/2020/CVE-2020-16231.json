Affected controllers that are actively supported include MX207, MX213, MX220, MC206, MC212, MC220, and MH230 hardware controllers, and affected end-of-life controller include MC205, MC210, MH212, ME203, CS200, MP213, MP226, MPC240, MPC265, MPC270, MPC293, MPE270, and CPC210 hardware controllers. Security Level 0 is set at default from the manufacturer, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain access to the password hashes. Security Level 4 is susceptible if an authenticated remote attacker or an unauthenticated person with physical access to the device reads and decrypts the password to conduct further attacks.", "PRODUIT": "bachmann"}
