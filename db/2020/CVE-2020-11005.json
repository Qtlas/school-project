If the library is used to encrypt text and write the output to a txt file, another executable could be able to decrypt the text using the static method NCryptDecrypt from this same library without the need to use Windows Hello Authentication again. This has been patched in version 1.0.4.", "PRODUIT": ["windowshello_project", "windowshello_project$PRODUCT$windowshello"]}
