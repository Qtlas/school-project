In HtmlSanitizer before version 5.0.372, there is a possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag. The problem has been fixed in version 5.0.372.", "VENDOR": ["htmlsanitizer_project", "htmlsanitizer_project$PRODUCT$htmlsanitizer"]}
