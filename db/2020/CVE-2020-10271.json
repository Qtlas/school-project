{"CVE": "CVE-2020-10271", "CWE": ["CWE-668"], "DATE": "2020-06-24T05:15:12", "CVSS": 9.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "RVD#2555: MiR ROS computational graph is exposed to all network interfaces, including poorly secured wireless networks and open wired ones", "DESC": "MiR100, MiR200 and other MiR robots use the Robot Operating System (ROS) default packages exposing the computational graph to all network interfaces, wireless and wired. This is the result of a bad set up and can be mitigated by appropriately configuring ROS and/or applying custom patches as appropriate. Currently, the ROS computational graph can be accessed fully from the wired exposed ports. In combination with other flaws such as CVE-2020-10269, the computation graph can also be fetched and interacted from wireless networks. This allows a malicious operator to take control of the ROS logic and correspondingly, the complete robot given that MiR's operations are centered around the framework (ROS).", "VENDOR": ["aliasrobotics", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir100", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir1000", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir1000_firmware", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir100_firmware", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir200", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir200_firmware", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir250", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir250_firmware", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir500", "aliasrobotics$PRODUCT$mir500_firmware", "enabled-robotics", "enabled-robotics$PRODUCT$er-flex", "enabled-robotics$PRODUCT$er-flex_firmware", "enabled-robotics$PRODUCT$er-lite", "enabled-robotics$PRODUCT$er-lite_firmware", "enabled-robotics$PRODUCT$er-one", "enabled-robotics$PRODUCT$er-one_firmware", "mobile-industrial-robotics", "mobile-industrial-robotics$PRODUCT$er200", "mobile-industrial-robotics$PRODUCT$er200_firmware", "uvd-robots", "uvd-robots$PRODUCT$uvd_robots", "uvd-robots$PRODUCT$uvd_robots_firmware"]}
