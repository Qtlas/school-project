By manipulating a certain kernel boot parameter, it can be tricked into dropping into a root shell in a pre-install phase where the entire source code of the appliance is available and can be retrieved. (The source code is otherwise inaccessible because the appliance has its hard disks encrypted, and no root shell is available during normal operation.)", "VENDOR": ["ivanti", "ivanti$PRODUCT$connect_secure", "ivanti$PRODUCT$policy_secure", "pulsesecure", "pulsesecure$PRODUCT$pulse_connect_secure", "pulsesecure$PRODUCT$pulse_policy_secure"]}
