An attacker team could potentially steal flags by, for example, exploiting a stored XSS payload in a CTF challenge so that victim teams who solve the challenge are unknowingly (and against their will) signed into the attacker team&#39;s account. Then, the attacker can gain points / value off the backs of the victims. This is patched in version 2.3.", "VENDOR": ["ctfd", "ctfd$PRODUCT$rctf"]}
