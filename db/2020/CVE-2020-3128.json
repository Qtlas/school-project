The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements within a Webex recording that is stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious ARF or WRF file to a user through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_meetings", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_meetings_online", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_meetings_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_network_recording_player"]}
