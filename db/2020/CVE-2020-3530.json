The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect mapping in the source code of task group assignments for a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing the command, which they should not be authorized to issue, on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to invalidate the integrity of the disk and cause the device to restart. This vulnerability could allow a user with read permissions to issue a specific command that should require Administrator privileges.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9001", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9010", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9901", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9904", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9906", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9910", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9912", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9922", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1001", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1002", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1004", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5001", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5002", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5011", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5501", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5501-se", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5502", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5502-se", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5508", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5516"]}
