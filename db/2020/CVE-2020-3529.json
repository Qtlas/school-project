The vulnerability is due to inefficient direct memory access (DMA) memory management during the negotiation phase of an SSL VPN connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted Datagram TLS (DTLS) traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust DMA memory on the device and cause a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
