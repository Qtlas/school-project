The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci_compute_node", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci_compute_node_bios", "netapp$PRODUCT$solidfire_\\&_hci_management_node", "netapp$PRODUCT$solidfire_\\&_hci_storage_node", "xen", "xen$PRODUCT$xen"]}
