The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the logic that governs directory permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using capabilities that are not controlled by the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on an affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$enterprise_network_function_virtualization_infrastructure"]}
