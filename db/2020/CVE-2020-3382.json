The vulnerability exists because different installations share a static encryption key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static key to craft a valid session token. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$data_center_network_manager"]}
