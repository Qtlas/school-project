The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of modified HTTP packets used in chunked responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured File Policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-8p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101-4p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109-2p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109-4p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x-8p", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4461_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$cloud_services_router_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense", "cisco$PRODUCT$isa_3000", "cisco$PRODUCT$isrv", "cisco$PRODUCT$meraki_mx", "snort", "snort$PRODUCT$snort"]}
