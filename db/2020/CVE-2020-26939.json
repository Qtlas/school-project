This occurs in org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding. Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption.", "VENDOR": ["bouncycastle", "bouncycastle$PRODUCT$fips_java_api", "bouncycastle$PRODUCT$legion-of-the-bouncy-castle"]}
