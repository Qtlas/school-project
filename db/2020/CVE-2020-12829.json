This flaw occurs in the COPY_AREA macro while handling MMIO write operations through the sm501_2d_engine_write() callback. A local attacker could abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process in sm501_2d_operation() in hw/display/sm501.c on the host, resulting in a denial of service.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu"]}
