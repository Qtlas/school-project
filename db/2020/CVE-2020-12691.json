Any authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified role on, and then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.", "PRODUIT": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "openstack", "openstack$PRODUCT$keystone"]}
