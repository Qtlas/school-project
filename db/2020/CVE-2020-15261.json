Since Veyon users (both students and teachers) usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all potentially untrustworthy users.", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "veyon", "veyon$PRODUCT$veyon"]}
