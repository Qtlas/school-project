One of the limitations of this feature is that it only takes a path to a binary without arguments; however, this can be circumvented using special shell variables, such as '${IFS}'. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as 'root' on the units.", "VENDOR": ["moog", "moog$PRODUCT$exvf5c-2", "moog$PRODUCT$exvf5c-2_firmware", "moog$PRODUCT$exvp7c2-3", "moog$PRODUCT$exvp7c2-3_firmware"]}
