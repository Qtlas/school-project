An attacker could take advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts, such as ansible_hosts, users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation or code injection.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$ansible", "redhat$PRODUCT$ansible_tower", "redhat$PRODUCT$openstack"]}
