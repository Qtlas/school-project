This means that an attacker getting access to a remember-me token for one server can get access to all servers which allow log-in using the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1", "VENDOR": ["apereo", "apereo$PRODUCT$opencast"]}
