The vulnerability is due to improper memory protection mechanisms while processing certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malformed OSPF packets in a short period of time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506h-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506w-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5508-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5516-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
