There is a Authentication Bypass in the Web Interface. This interface does not properly restrict access to internal functionality. Despite presenting a password login page on first access, authentication is not required to access privileged functionality. As such, it's possible to directly access APIs that should not be exposed to an unauthenticated user.", "VENDOR": ["librewireless", "librewireless$PRODUCT$ls9", "librewireless$PRODUCT$ls9_firmware"]}
