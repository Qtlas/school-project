The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on Lua function calls within the context of user-supplied Lua scripts. An attacker with valid administrative credentials could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious Lua script. When this file is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition could occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux OS of the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1120_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1160_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4321_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4351_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4451-x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4461_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-hx", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-hx", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1004", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1006-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1009-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1013", "cisco$PRODUCT$cbr-8_converged_broadband_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$cloud_services_router_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
