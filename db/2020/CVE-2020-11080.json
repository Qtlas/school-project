The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "nghttp2", "nghttp2$PRODUCT$nghttp2", "nodejs", "nodejs$PRODUCT$node.js", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$banking_extensibility_workbench", "oracle$PRODUCT$blockchain_platform", "oracle$PRODUCT$enterprise_communications_broker", "oracle$PRODUCT$graalvm", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql"]}
