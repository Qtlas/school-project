An attacker can import a file even when the target page is protected against \"page creation\" and the attacker should not be able to create it. This occurs because of a mishandled distinction between an upload restriction and a create restriction. An attacker cannot leverage this to overwrite anything, but can leverage this to force a wiki to have a page with a disallowed title.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "mediawiki", "mediawiki$PRODUCT$mediawiki"]}
