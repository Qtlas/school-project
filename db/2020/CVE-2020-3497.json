These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
