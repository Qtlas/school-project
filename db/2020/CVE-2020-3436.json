The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not efficiently handle the writing of large files to specific folders on the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to those specific folders. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write a file that triggers a watchdog timeout, which would cause the device to unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
