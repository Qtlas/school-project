Users within LogRhythm can be delegated different roles and privileges, intended to limit what data and services they can interact with. However, no access control is enforced for WebSocket-based communication to the PM application server, which will forward requests to any configured back-end server, regardless of whether the user's access rights should permit this. As a result, even the most low-privileged user can interact with any back-end component that has a LogRhythm agent installed.", "VENDOR": ["logrhythm", "logrhythm$PRODUCT$platform_manager"]}
