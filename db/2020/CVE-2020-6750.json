This bug is timing-dependent and may occur only sporadically depending on network delays. The greatest security relevance is in use cases where a proxy is used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though there is no technical barrier to a direct connection. NOTE: versions before 2.60 are unaffected.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "gnome", "gnome$PRODUCT$glib"]}
