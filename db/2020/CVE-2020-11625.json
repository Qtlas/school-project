Failed web UI login attempts elicit different responses depending on whether a user account exists. Because the responses indicate whether a submitted username is valid or not, they make it easier to identify legitimate usernames. If a login request is sent to ISAPI/Security/sessionLogin/capabilities using a username that exists, it will return the value of the salt given to that username, even if the password is incorrect. However, if a login request is sent using a username that is not present in the database, it will return an empty salt value. This allows attackers to enumerate legitimate usernames, facilitating brute-force attacks. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2020-7057.", "VENDOR": ["avertx", "avertx$PRODUCT$hd438", "avertx$PRODUCT$hd438_firmware", "avertx$PRODUCT$hd838", "avertx$PRODUCT$hd838_firmware"]}
