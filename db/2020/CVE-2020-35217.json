Instead of comparing the CSRF token in the request with the CSRF token in the cookie, it compares the CSRF token in the cookie against a CSRF token that is stored in the session. An attacker does not even need to provide a CSRF token in the request because the framework does not consider it. The cookies are automatically sent by the browser and the verification will always succeed, leading to a successful CSRF attack.", "VENDOR": ["eclipse", "eclipse$PRODUCT$vert.x-web"]}
