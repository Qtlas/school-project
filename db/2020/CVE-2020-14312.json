In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora"]}
