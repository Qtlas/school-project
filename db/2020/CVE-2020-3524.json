The vulnerability is due to the presence of a debugging configuration option in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device through the console, forcing the device into ROMMON mode, and writing a malicious pattern using that specific option on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to break the chain of trust and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4461_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-10sz-pd", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-12cz-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-12cz-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-12sz-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-12sz-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-20sz-m", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-24sz-im", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-24sz-m", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-24tz-m", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-4sz-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr-920-4sz-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1000-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1004", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1013", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920u-12sz-im", "cisco$PRODUCT$cbr8", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe_rom_monitor"]}
