If the \u2018createMBServerConnectorFactory\u2018 property of the default InstrumentationManagerImpl is not disabled, then it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) style attack. An attacker on the same host can connect to the registry and rebind the entry to another server, thus acting as a proxy to the original. They are then able to gain access to all of the information that is sent and received over JMX.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$cxf", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_workflow_automation", "netapp$PRODUCT$snapmanager", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_diameter_signaling_router", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_diameter_signaling_router_idih\\", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_element_manager", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_session_report_manager", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_session_route_manager", "oracle$PRODUCT$enterprise_manager_base_platform", "oracle$PRODUCT$peoplesoft_enterprise_peopletools"]}
