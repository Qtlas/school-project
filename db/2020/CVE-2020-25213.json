This, for example, allows attackers to run the elFinder upload (or mkfile and put) command to write PHP code into the wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/ directory. This was exploited in the wild in August and September 2020.", "VENDOR": ["filemanagerpro", "filemanagerpro$PRODUCT$file_manager"]}
