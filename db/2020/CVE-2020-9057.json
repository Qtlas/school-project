An attacker can also capture and replay Z-Wave traffic. Firmware upgrades cannot directly address this vulnerability as it is an issue with the Z-Wave specification for these legacy chipsets. One way to protect against this vulnerability is to use 500 or 700 series chipsets that support Security 2 (S2) encryption. As examples, the Linear WADWAZ-1 version 3.43 and WAPIRZ-1 version 3.43 (with 300 series chipsets) are vulnerable.", "VENDOR": ["linear", "linear$PRODUCT$wadwaz-1", "linear$PRODUCT$wapirz-1", "silabs", "silabs$PRODUCT$100_series_firmware", "silabs$PRODUCT$200_series_firmware", "silabs$PRODUCT$300_series_firmware"]}
