An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve the memory address of a kernel object.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles memory addresses.\n", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019"]}
