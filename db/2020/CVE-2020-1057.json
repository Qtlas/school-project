An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the ChakraCore scripting engine handles objects in memory.</p>\n", "PRODUIT": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$chakracore", "microsoft$PRODUCT$edge", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019"]}
