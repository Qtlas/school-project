The vulnerability is due to the presence of weak, hard-coded credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and then connecting to VDS through the device&rsquo;s virtual console by using the static credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the Linux shell of VDS as the root user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1120", "cisco$PRODUCT$1240", "cisco$PRODUCT$809", "cisco$PRODUCT$829", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios"]}
