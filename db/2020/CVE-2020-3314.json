The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of specific file attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted file to a user of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service to crash, resulting in missed detection and logging of the potentially malicious file. Continued attempts to scan the file could result in a DoS condition of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$advanced_malware_protection_for_endpoints"]}
