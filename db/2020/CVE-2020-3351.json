The vulnerability is due to improper validation of fields in Cisco SD-WAN peering messages that are encapsulated in UDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP messages to the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause services on the device to fail, resulting in a DoS condition that could impact the targeted device and other devices that depend on it.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$sd-wan_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_1000", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100b", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100m", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100wm", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_2000", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_5000", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_cloud_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$vsmart_controller"]}
