The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific VDS-related CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1120", "cisco$PRODUCT$1240", "cisco$PRODUCT$809", "cisco$PRODUCT$829", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios"]}
