These vulnerabilities are due to missing checks when the IP cameras process a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP camera or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$8000p_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8000p_ip_camera_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$8020_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8020_ip_camera_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$8030_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8030_ip_camera_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$8070_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8070_ip_camera_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$8400_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8400_ip_camera_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$8620_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8620_ip_camera_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$8630_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8630_ip_camera_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$8930_speed_dome_ip_camera", "cisco$PRODUCT$8930_speed_dome_ip_camera_firmware"]}
