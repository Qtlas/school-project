The vulnerability exists because the IP SLA responder could consume a port that could be used by another feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IP SLA control packets to the IP SLA responder on an affected device. The control packets must include the port number that could be used by another configured feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an in-use port to be consumed by the IP SLA responder, impacting the feature that was using the port and resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1120_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1160_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4461_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-hx", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-hx", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1004", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1006-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1009-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1013", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3650", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_3850", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9200", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9400", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9500", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9600", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800", "cisco$PRODUCT$csr_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
