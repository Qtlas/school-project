{"CVE": "CVE-2020-15137", "CWE": ["CWE-190"], "DATE": "2020-08-12T17:15:11", "CVSS": 5.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "TITLE": "Integer overflow in HoRNDIS", "DESC": "All versions of HoRNDIS are affected by an integer overflow in the RNDIS packet parsing routines. A malicious USB device can trigger disclosure of unrelated kernel memory to userspace applications on the host, or can cause the kernel to crash. Kernel memory disclosure is especially likely on 32-bit kernels; 64-bit kernels are more likely to crash on attempted exploitation. It is not believed that kernel memory corruption is possible, or that unattended kernel memory disclosure without the collaboration of a userspace program running on the host is possible. The vulnerability is in `HoRNDIS::receivePacket`. `msg_len`, `data_ofs`, and `data_len` can be controlled by an attached USB device, and a negative value of `data_ofs` can bypass the check for `(data_ofs + data_len + 8) > msg_len`, and subsequently can cause a wild pointer copy in the `mbuf_copyback` call. The software is not maintained and no patches are planned. Users of multi-tenant systems with HoRNDIS installed should only connect trusted USB devices to their system.", "VENDOR": ["horndis_project", "horndis_project$PRODUCT$horndis"]}
