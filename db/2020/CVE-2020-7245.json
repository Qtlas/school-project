To exploit the vulnerability, one must register with a username identical to the victim's username, but with white space inserted before and/or after the username. This will register the account with the same username as the victim. After initiating a password reset for the new account, CTFd will reset the victim's account password due to the username collision.", "PRODUIT": ["ctfd", "ctfd$PRODUCT$ctfd"]}
