The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_firmware"]}
