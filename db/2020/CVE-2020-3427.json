This allows an attacker with local user privileges to coerce the installer to write to arbitrary privileged directories. If successful, an attacker can manipulate files used by Windows Logon, cause Denial of Service (DoS) by deleting file(s), or replace system files to potentially achieve elevation of privileges. Note that this can only exploitable during new installations while the installer is running and is not exploitable once installation is finished. Versions 4.1.2 of Windows Logon addresses this issue.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$duo_authentication_for_windows_logon_and_rdp"]}
