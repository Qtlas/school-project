The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation upon receiving ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of crafted ICMP or ICMPv6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion condition that may result in an unexpected reload. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after the reload.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4110", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4112", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4115", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4125", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4145", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4150", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
