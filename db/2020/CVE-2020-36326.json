NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2018-19296, but arose because 6.1.8 fixed a functionality problem in which UNC pathnames were always considered unreadable by PHPMailer, even in safe contexts. As an unintended side effect, this fix eliminated the code that blocked addAttachment exploitation.", "PRODUIT": ["phpmailer_project", "phpmailer_project$PRODUCT$phpmailer", "wordpress", "wordpress$PRODUCT$wordpress"]}
