The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted HTTP requests to the affected web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing new connections and could result in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4gltegb_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4gltena_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-6g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$sd-wan_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_1000", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100b", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100m", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100wm", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_2000", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_5000"]}
