The attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>\n", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$sharepoint_enterprise_server", "microsoft$PRODUCT$sharepoint_foundation", "microsoft$PRODUCT$sharepoint_server"]}
