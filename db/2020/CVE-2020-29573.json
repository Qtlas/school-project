NOTE: the issue does not affect glibc by default in 2016 or later (i.e., 2.23 or later) because of commits made in 2015 for inlining of C99 math functions through use of GCC built-ins. In other words, the reference to 2.23 is intentional despite the mention of \"Fixed for glibc 2.33\" in the 26649 reference.", "VENDOR": ["gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$glibc", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$cloud_backup", "netapp$PRODUCT$solidfire_baseboard_management_controller", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
