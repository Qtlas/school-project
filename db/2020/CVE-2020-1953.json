Apache Commons Configuration versions 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 did not change the default settings of this library. So if a YAML file was loaded from an untrusted source, it could therefore load and execute code out of the control of the host application.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$commons_configuration", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$database_server", "oracle$PRODUCT$healthcare_foundation"]}
