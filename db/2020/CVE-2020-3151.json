The vulnerability is due to insufficient security mechanisms in the restricted shell implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and execute a set of normally unauthorized commands with the privileges of a non-root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$connected_mobile_experiences"]}
