The patch resets the depth to a proper size before throwing an exception. The memory leak can be triggered by a crafted input file that is processed by ImageMagick and could cause an impact to application reliability, such as denial of service. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.", "PRODUIT": ["imagemagick", "imagemagick$PRODUCT$imagemagick"]}
