Once an individual device's firmware is updated, and authentication occurs once, the cloud service recategorizes the device so that authentication is subsequently always required, and spoofing cannot occur.", "PRODUIT": ["loxone", "loxone$PRODUCT$miniserver_gen_1", "loxone$PRODUCT$miniserver_gen_1_firmware"]}
