A remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the Bogus DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC Secure state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service for installation that always validate (dnssec=validate), and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process).", "VENDOR": ["opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$backports_sle", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "powerdns", "powerdns$PRODUCT$recursor"]}
