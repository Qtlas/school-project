A specially crafted network request can cause a loss of communications with the device resulting in denial-of-service. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.If the Simple Segment Sub-Type is supplied, the device treats the byte following as the Data Size in words. When this value represents a size greater than what remains in the packet data, the device enters a fault state where communication with the device is lost and a physical power cycle is required.", "VENDOR": ["rockwellautomation", "rockwellautomation$PRODUCT$flex_i\\/o_1794-aent\\/b", "rockwellautomation$PRODUCT$flex_i\\/o_1794-aent\\/b_firmware"]}
