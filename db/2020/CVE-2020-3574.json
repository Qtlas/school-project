The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP ingress packet rate limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact operations of the phone or cause the phone to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_210", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_210_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_6825", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_6825_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8811", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8811_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8841", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8841_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8851", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8851_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8861", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8861_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_ip_conference_phone_8831", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_ip_conference_phone_8831_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_room_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_room_phone_firmware"]}
