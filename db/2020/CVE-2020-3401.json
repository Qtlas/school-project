The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files on the affected system.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4gltegb_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4gltena_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-6g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$sd-wan_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_1000", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100b", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100m", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_100wm", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_2000", "cisco$PRODUCT$vedge_5000"]}
