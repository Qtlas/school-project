This overflow condition in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by coring the CFM daemon. Continued receipt of these packets may cause an extended Denial of Service condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S15; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D95 on SRX Series; 14.1X50 versions prior to 14.1X50-D145; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D47; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R2; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D170 on SRX Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D67.", "VENDOR": ["juniper", "juniper$PRODUCT$junos"]}
