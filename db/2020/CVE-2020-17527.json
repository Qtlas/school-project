While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$tomcat", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$element_plug-in", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_system_manager", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$blockchain_platform", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_binding_support_function", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_policy", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_instant_messaging_server", "oracle$PRODUCT$instantis_enterprisetrack", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_enterprise_monitor", "oracle$PRODUCT$sd-wan_edge", "oracle$PRODUCT$workload_manager"]}
