The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action.", "VENDOR": ["git-tag-annotation-action_project", "git-tag-annotation-action_project$PRODUCT$git-tag-annotation-action"]}
