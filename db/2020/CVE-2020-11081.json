If a Window system is configured with a PATH that contains a user-writable directory then a local user may write a zlib1.dll DLL, which osquery will attempt to load. Since osquery runs with elevated privileges this enables local escalation. This is fixed in version 4.4.0.", "VENDOR": ["linuxfoundation", "linuxfoundation$PRODUCT$osquery"]}
