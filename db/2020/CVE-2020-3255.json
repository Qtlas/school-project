The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic through an affected device. This traffic would need to match a configured block action in an access control policy. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion condition on the affected device, which would result in a DoS for traffic transiting the device, as well as sluggish performance of the management interface. Once the flood is stopped, performance should return to previous states.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5510", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5510_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5520", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5520_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5540", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5540_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5550", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5550_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
