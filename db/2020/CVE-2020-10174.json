It follows symlinks in this location or uses directories owned by unprivileged users. Because Timeshift also executes scripts under this location, an attacker can attempt to win a race condition to replace scripts created by Timeshift with attacker-controlled scripts. Upon success, an attacker-controlled script is executed with full root privileges. This logic is practically always triggered when Timeshift runs regardless of the command-line arguments used.", "PRODUIT": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "timeshift_project", "timeshift_project$PRODUCT$timeshift"]}
