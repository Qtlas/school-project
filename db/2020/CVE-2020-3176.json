The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying certain CLI commands with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, which could result in a complete system compromise.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$remote_phy_120", "cisco$PRODUCT$remote_phy_120_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$remote_phy_220", "cisco$PRODUCT$remote_phy_220_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$remote_phy_shelf_7200", "cisco$PRODUCT$remote_phy_shelf_7200_firmware"]}
