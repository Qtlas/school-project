There is no disclosure of the specific version. The functionality on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and is not known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side-effect, this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other resources on this path (e.g. a page).", "VENDOR": ["silverstripe", "silverstripe$PRODUCT$silverstripe"]}
