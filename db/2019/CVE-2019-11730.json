The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "mozilla", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox_esr", "mozilla$PRODUCT$thunderbird", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "suse", "suse$PRODUCT$linux_enterprise", "suse$PRODUCT$package_hub"]}
