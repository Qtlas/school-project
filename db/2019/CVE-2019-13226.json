An unprivileged user can prepare a symlink at this location to have the file system mounted in an arbitrary location. By winning a race condition, the attacker can also enter the mount point, thereby preventing a subsequent unmount of the file system.", "PRODUIT": ["deepin", "deepin$PRODUCT$deepin-clone", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora"]}
