An attacker may send an HTTP POST request to the /cgi-bin/reader URI. The attacker must include a Content-length header with a large positive value that, when represented in 32 bit binary, evaluates to a negative number. The problem exists in the http_cgi_write function under http-cgi.c; however, exploitation might show svz_envblock_add in libserveez/passthrough.c as the location of the heap-based buffer over-read.", "PRODUIT": ["gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$serveez"]}
