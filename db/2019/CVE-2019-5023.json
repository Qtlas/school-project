PaX adds a temp buffer to the read_kmem function, which is never freed when an invalid address is supplied. This results in a memory leakage that can lead to a crash of the system. An attacker needs to induce a read to /dev/kmem using an invalid address to exploit this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["opensrcsec", "opensrcsec$PRODUCT$grsecurity", "opensrcsec$PRODUCT$pax"]}
