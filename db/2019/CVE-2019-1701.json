{"CVE": "CVE-2019-1701", "CWE": ["CWE-79"], "DATE": "2019-05-03T16:29:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance and Firepower Threat Defense Software WebVPN Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities", "DESC": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the WebVPN service of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the WebVPN portal of an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist because the software insufficiently validates user-supplied input on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. An attacker would need administrator privileges on the device to exploit these vulnerabilities.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5510", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5520", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5540", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5550", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
