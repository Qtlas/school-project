There is WAN remote code execution without user interaction. An attacker could retrieve the AWS key from the firmware and obtain full control over Linkplay's AWS estate, including S3 buckets containing device firmware. When combined with an OS command injection vulnerability within the XML Parsing logic of the firmware update process, an attacker would be able to gain code execution on any device that attempted to update. Note that by default all devices tested had automatic updates enabled.", "PRODUIT": ["linkplay", "linkplay$PRODUCT$linkplay"]}
