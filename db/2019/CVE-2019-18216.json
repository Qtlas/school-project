Attackers who have physical laptop access can exhaust the main battery to reset the BIOS configuration, and then achieve direct access to the hard drive by booting a live USB OS without disassembling the laptop. NOTE: the vendor has apparently indicated that this is \"normal\" and use of the same battery for the BIOS and the overall system is a \"new design.\" However, the vendor apparently plans to \"improve\" this an unspecified later time", "VENDOR": ["asus", "asus$PRODUCT$rog_zephyrus_m_gm501gs", "asus$PRODUCT$rog_zephyrus_m_gm501gs_firmware"]}
