The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages system resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a large number of simultaneous sessions on the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition of the web-based management interface, preventing normal management operations.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ic3000_industrial_compute_gateway", "cisco$PRODUCT$ic3000_industrial_compute_gateway_firmware"]}
