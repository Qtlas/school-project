An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject code into a CAB file without invalidating the file's signature.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could modify a signed CAB file and inject malicious code. The attacker could then convince a target user to execute the file.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures.\n", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019"]}
