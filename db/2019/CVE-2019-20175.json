The guest system can crash the QEMU process in the host system via a special SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND. It hits an assertion that implies that the size of successful DMA transfers there must be a multiple of 512 (the size of a sector). NOTE: a member of the QEMU security team disputes the significance of this issue because a \"privileged guest user has many ways to cause similar DoS effect, without triggering this assert.", "PRODUIT": ["qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu"]}
