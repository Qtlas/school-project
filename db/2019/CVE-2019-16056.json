The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_operations_monitor", "oracle$PRODUCT$peoplesoft_enterprise_peopletools", "oracle$PRODUCT$solaris", "oracle$PRODUCT$zfs_storage_appliance_kit", "python", "python$PRODUCT$python", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$software_collections"]}
