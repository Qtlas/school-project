The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied commands. An attacker who has administrator privileges and access to the network where the IPMI resides could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$encs_5100", "cisco$PRODUCT$encs_5400", "cisco$PRODUCT$integrated_management_controller_supervisor", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e1120d-m3", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e140s-m2", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e160d-m2", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e160s-m3", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e168d-m2", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e180d-m3", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c125_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c4200", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_s3260", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system"]}
