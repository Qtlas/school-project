The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system by using a web browser and with the privileges of the user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_af_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_af_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_all_nvme_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_all_nvme_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_edge_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_edge_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx220c_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx240c_af_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx240c_af_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx240c_large_form_factor", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx240c_large_form_factor_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx240c_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$hx240c_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_b200_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_b200_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_b480_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_b480_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c125_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c125_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c220_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c220_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c240_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c240_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c480_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c480_m5_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c480_ml", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c480_ml_firmware"]}
