A remote authenticated malicious user can modify the metadata file of a Bosh Backup and Restore job to request extra backup files from different jobs upon restore. The exploited hooks in this metadata script were only maintained in the cfcr-etcd-release, so clusters deployed with the BBR job for etcd in this release are vulnerable.", "VENDOR": ["cloudfoundry", "cloudfoundry$PRODUCT$bosh_backup_and_restore"]}
