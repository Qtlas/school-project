An attacker could target the traffic sent from Wildfly and downgrade the connection to a weaker version of TLS, potentially breaking the encryption. This could lead to a leak of the data being passed over the network. Wildfly version 7.2.0.GA, 7.2.3.GA and 7.2.5.CR2 are believed to be vulnerable.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_data_grid", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_enterprise_application_platform", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_fuse", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_application_runtimes", "redhat$PRODUCT$single_sign-on", "redhat$PRODUCT$wildfly"]}
