By running \"select hostdetails from hostdetails\" at the /event/runquery.do endpoint, it is possible to bypass the security restrictions that prevent even administrative users from viewing credential data stored in the database, and recover the MD5 hashes of the accounts used to authenticate the ManageEngine platform to the managed machines on the network (most often administrative accounts). Specifically, this bypasses these restrictions: a query cannot mention password, and a query result cannot have a password column.", "VENDOR": ["zohocorp", "zohocorp$PRODUCT$manageengine_eventlog_analyzer"]}
