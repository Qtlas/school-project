This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "PRODUIT": ["agendaless", "agendaless$PRODUCT$waitress", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_network_function_cloud_native_environment", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$openstack"]}
