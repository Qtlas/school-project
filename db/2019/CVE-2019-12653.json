The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of Raw Socket Transport payloads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a TCP session and then sending a malicious TCP segment via IPv4 to an affected device. This cannot be exploited via IPv6, as the Raw Socket Transport feature does not support IPv6 as a network layer protocol.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_902", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_902u", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_903", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_907", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_914", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
