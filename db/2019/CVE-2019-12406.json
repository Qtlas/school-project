This leaves open the possibility of a denial of service type attack, where a malicious user crafts a message containing a very large number of message attachments. From the 3.3.4 and 3.2.11 releases, a default limit of 50 message attachments is enforced. This is configurable via the message property \"attachment-max-count\".", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$cxf", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$commerce_guided_search", "oracle$PRODUCT$flexcube_private_banking", "oracle$PRODUCT$retail_order_broker"]}
