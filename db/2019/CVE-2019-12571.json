When the client initiates a connection, the XML /tmp/pia-watcher.plist file is created. If the file exists, it will be truncated and the contents completely overwritten. This file is removed on disconnect. An unprivileged user can create a hard or soft link to arbitrary files owned by any user on the system, including root. This creates a denial of service condition and possible data loss if leveraged by a malicious local user.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "londontrustmedia", "londontrustmedia$PRODUCT$private_internet_access_vpn_client"]}
