The vulnerability is due to a logic error with how the software cryptography module handles IPsec sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating and sending traffic in a high number of IPsec sessions through the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5506-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5506h-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5506w-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5508-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5516-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5555-x"]}
