The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific VMAN CLI command on the affected device. An attacker who has administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
