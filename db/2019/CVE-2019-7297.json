A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via shell metacharacters in a crafted /HNAP1 request. This occurs when the GetNetworkTomographyResult function calls the system function with an untrusted input parameter named Address. Consequently, an attacker can execute any command remotely when they control this input.", "PRODUIT": ["d-link", "d-link$PRODUCT$dir-823g_firmware", "dlink", "dlink$PRODUCT$dir-823g"]}
