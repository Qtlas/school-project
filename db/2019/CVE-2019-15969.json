The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script or HTML code in the context of the interface, which could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive, browser-based information.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$web_security_appliance"]}
