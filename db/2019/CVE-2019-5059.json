A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["libsdl", "libsdl$PRODUCT$sdl2_image", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$backports_sle", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap"]}
