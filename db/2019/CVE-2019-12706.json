The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates certain incoming SPF messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a custom SPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured header filters, which could allow malicious content to pass through the device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$email_security_appliance_firmware"]}
