The vulnerability is due to a lack of complete error handling condition for client authentication requests sent to a targeted interface configured for FT. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted authentication request traffic to the targeted interface, causing the device to restart unexpectedly.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$access_points", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3700e", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3700e_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3700i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3700i_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3700p", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3700p_firmware"]}
