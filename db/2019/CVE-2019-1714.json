The vulnerability is due to improper credential management when using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) or basic authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a VPN session to an affected device after another VPN user has successfully authenticated to the affected device via SAML SSO. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect to secured networks behind the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_virtual_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5506-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5506h-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5506w-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5508-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5516-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2110", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2130", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4100", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_9300", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense", "cisco$PRODUCT$isa_3000"]}
