The vulnerability is due to an incorrect allocation of an internal interface index. An adjacent attacker with the ability to submit a crafted FCoE packet that crosses affected interfaces could trigger this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet loop and high throughput on the affected interfaces, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.3(5)N1(1).", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_5600", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_6000", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os"]}
