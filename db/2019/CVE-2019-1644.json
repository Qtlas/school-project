The vulnerability is due to improper resource management for UDP ingress packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of UDP packets to an affected system within a short period of time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available system resources, resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$iot_field_network_director"]}
