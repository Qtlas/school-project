The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the web-based management interface and sending crafted requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Note: The web-based management interface is enabled by default.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa112", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa112_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa122", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa122_firmware"]}
