The vulnerability exists because affected devices use weak encryption algorithms for user credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypting intercepted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to an affected device with administrator privileges. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running firmware releases prior to 1.4.2.22.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_firmware"]}
