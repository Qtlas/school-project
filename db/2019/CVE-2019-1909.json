The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP update messages that include a specific set of attributes to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers only. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9001", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9010", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9901", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9904", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9906", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9910", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9912", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9920", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr"]}
