Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\nThe attacker could present to the user a removable drive, or remote share, that contains a malicious .LNK file and an associated malicious binary. When the user opens this drive(or remote share) in Windows Explorer, or any other application that parses the .LNK file, the malicious binary will execute code of the attacker\u2019s choice, on the target system.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the processing of shortcut LNK references.\n", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2016", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019"]}
