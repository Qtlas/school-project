This allows a local attacker, able to precisely measure the duration of signature operations, to infer information about the nonces used and potentially mount a lattice attack to recover the private key used. The issue occurs because ecc.c scalar multiplication might leak the bit length.", "PRODUIT": ["wolfssl", "wolfssl$PRODUCT$wolfssl"]}
