Headers such as X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options are generally advisable, however some information security professionals additionally look for X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies and X-XSS-Protection, which are more generally applicable to HTML endpoint, to be included too. These headers were not included in Couchbase Server 5.5.0 and 5.1.2 . They are now included in version 6.0.2 in responses from the Couchbase Server Views REST API (port 8092).", "PRODUIT": ["couchbase", "couchbase$PRODUCT$couchbase_server"]}
