The attacker would need valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input for certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and submitting crafted input for a CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain access to the underlying Linux OS without proper authentication.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1542d", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1542i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1562d", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1562e", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1562i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1800i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1850e", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1850i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_2800e", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_2800i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800e", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800i", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800p", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_access_point_firmware"]}
