For an rcp operation, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client machine. This is similar to CVE-2019-6111.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "netkit", "netkit$PRODUCT$netkit"]}
