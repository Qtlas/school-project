Next, he can change the directory that the application uploads files to, which allows him to achieve remote code execution. This occurs because install/include/header.php does not restrict certain changes (to db_host, db_login, db_password, and content_dir) within install/include/step5.php.", "PRODUIT": ["atutor", "atutor$PRODUCT$atutor"]}
