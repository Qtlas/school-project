The macOS binary openvpn_launcher.64 is setuid root. This binary creates /tmp/pia_upscript.sh when executed. Because the file creation mask (umask) is not reset, the umask value is inherited from the calling process. This value can be manipulated to cause the privileged binary to create files with world writable permissions. A local unprivileged user can modify /tmp/pia_upscript.sh during the connect process to execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "londontrustmedia", "londontrustmedia$PRODUCT$private_internet_access_vpn_client"]}
