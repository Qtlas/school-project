The vulnerability is due to a default local account with a static password. The account has privileges only to reboot the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by guessing the account name and password to access the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reboot the device repeatedly, creating a denial of service (DoS) condition. It is not possible to change the configuration or view sensitive data with this account. Versions prior to DNAC1.2.8 are affected.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_active_sensor", "cisco$PRODUCT$digital_network_architecture_center"]}
