It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a serve binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a serve binary would overwrite the previous serve binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "npmjs", "npmjs$PRODUCT$npm", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$graalvm", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_eus"]}
