The openvpn_launcher binary is setuid root. This binary supports the --log option, which accepts a path as an argument. This parameter is not sanitized, which allows a local unprivileged user to overwrite arbitrary files owned by any user on the system, including root. This creates a denial of service condition and possible data loss if leveraged by a malicious local user.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "londontrustmedia", "londontrustmedia$PRODUCT$private_internet_access_vpn_client"]}
