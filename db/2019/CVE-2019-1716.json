{"CVE": "CVE-2019-1716", "CWE": ["CWE-20"], "DATE": "2019-03-22T20:29:00.353000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series Remote Code Execution Vulnerability", "DESC": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input during user authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using HTTP and supplying malicious user credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, or to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the app user. Cisco fixed this vulnerability in the following SIP Software releases: 10.3(1)SR5 and later for Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831; 11.0(4)SR3 and later for Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 and later for the rest of the Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_conference_phone_7800", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_conference_phone_7800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8800", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8821", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8821-ex", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8821-ex_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8821_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_ip_conferenece_phone_8831", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_ip_conferenece_phone_8831_firmware"]}
