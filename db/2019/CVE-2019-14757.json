The pre-installed Contacts application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. An attacker can send a vCard file to the victim that will inject HTML into the Contacts application (assuming the victim chooses to import the file). At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Contacts application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.", "VENDOR": ["kaiostech", "kaiostech$PRODUCT$kaios"]}
