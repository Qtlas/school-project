Popular hashing algorithms based on the Merkle-Damgardconstruction (such as MD5 and SHA-1) alone are insufficient in thwarting password cracking. Attackers can generate and use precomputed hashes for all possible password character combinations (commonly referred to as \"rainbow tables\") relatively quickly. The use of adaptive hashing algorithms such asscryptorbcryptor Key-Derivation Functions (i.e.PBKDF2) to hash passwords make generation of such rainbow tables computationally infeasible.", "VENDOR": ["versa-networks", "versa-networks$PRODUCT$versa_analytics", "versa-networks$PRODUCT$versa_director", "versa-networks$PRODUCT$versa_operating_system"]}
