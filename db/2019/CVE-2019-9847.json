If the hyperlink is activated by the victim the executable target is unconditionally launched. Under Windows and macOS when processing a hyperlink target explicitly activated by the user there was no judgment made on whether the target was an executable file, so such executable targets were launched unconditionally. This issue affects: All LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions prior to 6.1.6; LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions in the 6.2 series prior to 6.2.3.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "libreoffice", "libreoffice$PRODUCT$libreoffice", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows"]}
