When the server administrator delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for certain databases but wants to maintain isolation (e.g., for multi-tenant deployments), slapd does not properly stop a rootDN from requesting authorization as an identity from another database during a SASL bind or with a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control. (It is not a common configuration to deploy a system where the server administrator and a DB administrator enjoy different levels of trust.)", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$mac_os_x", "canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "mcafee", "mcafee$PRODUCT$policy_auditor", "openldap", "openldap$PRODUCT$openldap", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$blockchain_platform", "oracle$PRODUCT$solaris", "oracle$PRODUCT$zfs_storage_appliance_kit"]}
