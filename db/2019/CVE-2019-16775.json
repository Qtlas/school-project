It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of thenode_modules folder through the bin field upon installation. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "npmjs", "npmjs$PRODUCT$npm", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$graalvm", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_eus"]}
