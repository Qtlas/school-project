The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the server firmware upgrade images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a server firmware version that would allow the attacker to disable UEFI Secure Boot. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the signature validation checks that are done by UEFI Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$fmc1000-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$fmc1000-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$fmc2500-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$fmc2500-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$fmc4500-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$fmc4500-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$identity_services_engine", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3515-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3515-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3595-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3595-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3615-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3615-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3655-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3655-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3695-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$sns-3695-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$tg5004-k9-rf_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$tg5004-k9-rf_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$tg5004-k9_bios", "cisco$PRODUCT$tg5004-k9_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system"]}
