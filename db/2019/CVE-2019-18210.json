NOTE: the discoverer and vendor disagree on whether Moodle customers have a reasonable expectation that anyone authenticated as a Teacher can be trusted with the ability to add arbitrary JavaScript (this ability is not documented on Moodle's Teacher_role page). Because the vendor has this expectation, they have stated \"this report has been closed as a false positive, and not a bug.\"", "VENDOR": ["moodle", "moodle$PRODUCT$moodle"]}
