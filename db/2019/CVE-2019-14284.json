Two consecutive ioctls can trigger the bug: the first one should set the drive geometry with .sect and .rate values that make F_SECT_PER_TRACK be zero. Next, the floppy format operation should be called. It can be triggered by an unprivileged local user even when a floppy disk has not been inserted. NOTE: QEMU creates the floppy device by default.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
