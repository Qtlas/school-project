The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_business_suite", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_meetings_online", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_meetings_server", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows"]}
