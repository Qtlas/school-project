Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "VENDOR": ["agendaless", "agendaless$PRODUCT$waitress", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_network_function_cloud_native_environment"]}
