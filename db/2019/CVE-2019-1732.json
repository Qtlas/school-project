The vulnerability is due to the lack of a proper locking mechanism on critical variables that need to stay static until used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a set of RPM-related CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary command injection. The attacker would need administrator credentials for the targeted device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3000", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3100", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3100-z", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3100v", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3200", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3400", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3500", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3524-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3524-xl", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3548-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3548-xl", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3600", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9000", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9200", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9300", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9500", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx_os"]}
