The vulnerability is due to inefficient MIME parsing routines that result in extremely long scan times of specially formatted email files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to scan the crafted email file indefinitely, resulting in a denial of service condition.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$email_security_appliance_firmware", "clamav", "clamav$PRODUCT$clamav", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
