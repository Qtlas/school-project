This provides everything that is needed for an attacker to hijack active connections inside the VPN tunnel.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$ipados", "apple$PRODUCT$iphone_os", "apple$PRODUCT$mac_os_x", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "apple$PRODUCT$tvos", "freebsd", "freebsd$PRODUCT$freebsd", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "openbsd", "openbsd$PRODUCT$openbsd"]}
