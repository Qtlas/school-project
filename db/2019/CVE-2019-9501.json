By supplying a vendor information element with a data length larger than 32 bytes, a heap buffer overflow is triggered in wlc_wpa_sup_eapol. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.", "PRODUIT": ["broadcom", "broadcom$PRODUCT$bcm4339", "broadcom$PRODUCT$bcm4339_firmware", "synology", "synology$PRODUCT$router_manager"]}
