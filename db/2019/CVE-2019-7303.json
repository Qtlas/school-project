The seccomp rules were generated to match 64-bit ioctl(2) commands on a 64-bit platform; however, the Linux kernel only uses the lower 32 bits to determine which ioctl(2) commands to run. This issue affects: Canonical snapd versions prior to 2.37.4.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$snapd", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux"]}
