{"CVE": "CVE-2019-1597", "CWE": ["CWE-20"], "DATE": "2019-03-07T19:29:00.270000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerabilities", "DESC": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) feature in Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of LDAP packets by an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending an LDAP packet crafted using Basic Encoding Rules (BER) to an affected device. The LDAP packet must have a source IP address of an LDAP server configured on the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
