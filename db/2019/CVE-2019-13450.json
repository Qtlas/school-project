{"CVE": "CVE-2019-13450", "CWE": ["CWE-862"], "DATE": "2019-07-09T06:15:10", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "In the Zoom Client through 4.4.4 and RingCentral 7.0.136380.0312 on macOS, remote attackers can force a user to join a video call with the video camera active. This occurs because any web site can interact with the Zoom web server on localhost port 19421 or 19424. NOTE: a machine remains vulnerable if the Zoom Client was installed in the past and then uninstalled. Blocking exploitation requires additional steps, such as the ZDisableVideo preference and/or killing the web server, deleting the ~/.zoomus directory, and creating a ~/.zoomus plain file.", "VENDOR": ["ringcentral", "ringcentral$PRODUCT$ringcentral", "zoom", "zoom$PRODUCT$zoom"]}
