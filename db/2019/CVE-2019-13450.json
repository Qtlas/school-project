This occurs because any web site can interact with the Zoom web server on localhost port 19421 or 19424. NOTE: a machine remains vulnerable if the Zoom Client was installed in the past and then uninstalled. Blocking exploitation requires additional steps, such as the ZDisableVideo preference and/or killing the web server, deleting the ~/.zoomus directory, and creating a ~/.zoomus plain file.", "PRODUIT": ["ringcentral", "ringcentral$PRODUCT$ringcentral", "zoom", "zoom$PRODUCT$zoom"]}
