This allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files in scenarios where an intermediate analysis result is archived for sharing with other persons. To achieve arbitrary code execution, one approach is to overwrite some critical Ghidra modules, e.g., the decompile module.", "VENDOR": ["nsa", "nsa$PRODUCT$ghidra"]}
