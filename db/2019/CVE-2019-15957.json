When processed, the commands will be executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as the root user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016_multi-wan_vpn", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016_multi-wan_vpn_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042_dual_wan_vpn", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082_dual_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082_dual_wan_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_dual_gigabit_wan_wf_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_firmware"]}
