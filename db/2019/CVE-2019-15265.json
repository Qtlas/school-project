The vulnerability occurs because BPDUs received from specific wireless clients are forwarded incorrectly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability on the wireless network by sending a steady stream of crafted BPDU frames. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a limited denial of service (DoS) attack because an AP port could go offline.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1540", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1540_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1560", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1560_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_2800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_2800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800_firmware"]}
