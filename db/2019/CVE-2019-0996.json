An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass OAuth protections and register an application on behalf of the targeted user.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a page specifically designed to cause a cross-site request. The attacker would then need to convince a targeted user to click a link to the malicious page.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Azure DevOps Server protects application registration requests.", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$azure_devops_server"]}
