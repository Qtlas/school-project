The attacker must authenticate with valid user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of a Bash shell command that allows role-based access control (RBAC) to be bypassed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the Bash prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privilege level by executing commands that should be restricted to other roles. For example, a dev-ops user could escalate their privilege level to admin with a successful exploit of this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3000", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3500", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_3600", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_7000", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_7700", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9000_in_aci_mode", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9000_in_standalone", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9500", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os"]}
