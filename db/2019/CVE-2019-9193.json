This functionality is enabled by default and can be abused to run arbitrary operating system commands on Windows, Linux, and macOS. NOTE: Third parties claim/state this is not an issue because PostgreSQL functionality for \u2018COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM\u2019 is acting as intended. References state that in PostgreSQL, a superuser can execute commands as the server user without using the \u2018COPY FROM PROGRAM\u2019.", "PRODUIT": ["postgresql", "postgresql$PRODUCT$postgresql"]}
