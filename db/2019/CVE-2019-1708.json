The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of certain MOBIKE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MOBIKE packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The MOBIKE feature is supported only for IPv4 addresses.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5506-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa-5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506h-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506w-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5508-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5516-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
