The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the firmware image file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing the BIOS upgrade utility with a specific set of options. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the firmware signature-verification process and install compromised BIOS firmware on an affected device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_c125_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_c220_m4", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_c220_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_c240_m4", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_c240_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_c460_m4", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_c480_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system_server_firmware"]}
