A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI via the redirect_uri parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code.", "VENDOR": ["oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$banking_corporate_lending", "pivotal_software", "pivotal_software$PRODUCT$spring_security_oauth"]}
