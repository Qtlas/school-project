The firmware hashes and encrypts passwords using a hardcoded cryptographic key in sal_util_str_encrypt() in libsal.so.0.0. The parameters (salt, IV, and key data) are used to encrypt and decrypt all passwords using AES256 in CBC mode. With the parameters known, all previously encrypted passwords can be decrypted. This includes the passwords that are part of configuration backups or otherwise embedded as part of the firmware.", "PRODUIT": "zyxel"}
