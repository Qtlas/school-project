The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could indirectly exploit the vulnerability by sending BGP EVPN update messages with a specific, malformed attribute to an affected system and waiting for a user on the device to display the EVPN operational routes&rsquo; status. If successful, the attacker could cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9001", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9010", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9901", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9904", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9906", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9910", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9912", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9922", "cisco$PRODUCT$crs", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1001", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1002", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1004", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5001", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5002", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_540", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_540l", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5501", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5501-se", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5502", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5502-se", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5508", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5516", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_560", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_6000", "cisco$PRODUCT$xrv_9000"]}
