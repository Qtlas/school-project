An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could attempt to force Outlook to load a local or remote message store (over SMB).\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker could send a specially crafted email to a victim. Outlook would then attempt to open a pre-configured message store contained in the email upon receipt of the email.\nThis update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring Office fully validates incoming email formatting before processing message content.\n", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$office", "microsoft$PRODUCT$office_365_proplus", "microsoft$PRODUCT$outlook"]}
