This behavior caused some stream functions, such as stream_get_line, to trigger an out-of-bounds read when operating on such malformed streams. The implementations were updated to return valid values consistently. This affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30 and 3.27.4 and below).", "PRODUIT": "facebook"}
