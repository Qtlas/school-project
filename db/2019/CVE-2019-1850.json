An attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker with elevated privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the administrative web management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary, system-level commands with root privileges on an affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$encs_5100", "cisco$PRODUCT$encs_5400", "cisco$PRODUCT$integrated_management_controller_supervisor", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e1120d-m3", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e140s-m2", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e160d-m2", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e160s-m3", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e168d-m2", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs-e180d-m3", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c125_m5", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_c4200", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_s3260", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_computing_system"]}
