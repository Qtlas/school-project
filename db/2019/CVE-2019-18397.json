Examples include any GNOME or GTK+ based application that uses Pango for text layout, as this internally uses FriBidi for bidirectional text layout. For example, the attacker can construct a crafted text file to be opened in GEdit, or a crafted IRC message to be viewed in HexChat.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$fribidi"]}
