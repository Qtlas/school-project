A low privileged local process can connect to this port and send an LPC_DATAGRAM, which triggers an Access Violation due to hardcoded NULLs used for Source parameter in a memcpy operation that is called for this handler. This results in CmdVirth.exe and its child svchost.exe instances to terminate.", "PRODUIT": ["comodo", "comodo$PRODUCT$antivirus"]}
