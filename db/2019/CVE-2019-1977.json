{"CVE": "CVE-2019-1977", "CWE": ["CWE-371"], "DATE": "2019-08-30T09:15:20.553000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches ACI Mode Border Leaf Endpoint Learning Vulnerability", "DESC": "A vulnerability within the Endpoint Learning feature of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches running in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an endpoint device in certain circumstances. The vulnerability is due to improper endpoint learning when packets are received on a specific port from outside the ACI fabric and destined to an endpoint located on a border leaf when Disable Remote Endpoint Learning has been enabled. This can result in a Remote (XR) entry being created for the impacted endpoint that will become stale if the endpoint migrates to a different port or leaf switch. This results in traffic not reaching the impacted endpoint until the Remote entry can be relearned by another mechanism.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9000", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93108tc-ex", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93108tc-fx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93120tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93128tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93180lc-ex", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93180yc-ex", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93180yc-fx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9332pq", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9336c-fx2", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9336pq", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9348gc-fxp", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9364c", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372px", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372px-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372tx-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9396px", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9396tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9504", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9508", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9516", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os"]}
