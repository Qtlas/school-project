An attacker could use this impersonated session to create a new user account or otherwise control the device with the privileges of the hijacked session. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper session management controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take control of an existing user session on the device. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that an authorized user session is active and that the attacker can craft an HTTP request to impersonate that session.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router_firmware"]}
