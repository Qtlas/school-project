Cache loading relies on pickle and, provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache grammar file and that its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This is disputed because \"the cache directory is not under control of the attacker in any common configuration.", "PRODUIT": "parso_project"}
