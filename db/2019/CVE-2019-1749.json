The vulnerability exists because the software insufficiently validates ingress traffic on the ASIC used on the RSP3 platform. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the iosd process, triggering a reload of the affected device and resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
