The reflected traffic is 6 times bigger than spoofed requests. This occurs because the construction of a \"4.01 Unauthorized\" response is mishandled. NOTE: the vendor states \"While this is an interesting attack, there is no plan for maintainer to fix, as we are migrating to IoTivity Lite.\"", "PRODUIT": ["iotivity", "iotivity$PRODUCT$iotivity"]}
