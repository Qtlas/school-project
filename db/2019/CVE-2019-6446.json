It uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example) loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated sources.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "numpy", "numpy$PRODUCT$numpy"]}
