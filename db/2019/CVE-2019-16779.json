Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "excon_project", "excon_project$PRODUCT$excon", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$backports_sle", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap"]}
