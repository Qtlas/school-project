A SIP request can be sent to Asterisk that can change a SIP peer's IP address. A REGISTER does not need to occur, and calls can be hijacked as a result. The only thing that needs to be known is the peer's name; authentication details such as passwords do not need to be known. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the nat option is set to the default, or auto_force_rport.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "digium", "digium$PRODUCT$asterisk", "digium$PRODUCT$certified_asterisk"]}
