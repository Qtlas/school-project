Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause a long-lived process(such as the RPC server) to terminate. (In the file server case, the most likely target, smbd, operates as process-per-client and so a crash there is harmless).", "PRODUIT": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$storage", "samba", "samba$PRODUCT$samba", "synology", "synology$PRODUCT$directory_server", "synology$PRODUCT$diskstation_manager", "synology$PRODUCT$router_manager", "synology$PRODUCT$skynas"]}
