This could result in script running where CSP should have blocked it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks when the product renders the content as HTML. Remediating this would also need to consider the polyglot case, e.g., a file that is a valid GIF image and also valid JavaScript.", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "midori-browser", "midori-browser$PRODUCT$midori"]}
