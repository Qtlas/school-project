The vulnerability is due to incorrect role-based access control (RBAC) evaluation when a low-privileged user requests access to a Guest OS that should be restricted to administrative accounts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the Guest OS by using the low-privileged-user credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest OS as a root user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$807_industrial_integrated_services_routers", "cisco$PRODUCT$809_industrial_integrated_services_routers", "cisco$PRODUCT$829_industrial_integrated_services_routers", "cisco$PRODUCT$cgr1240", "cisco$PRODUCT$cgr_1120", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios"]}
