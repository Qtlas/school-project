An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side channel attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "freebsd", "freebsd$PRODUCT$freebsd", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$backports_sle", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "synology", "synology$PRODUCT$radius_server", "synology$PRODUCT$router_manager", "w1.fi", "w1.fi$PRODUCT$hostapd", "w1.fi$PRODUCT$wpa_supplicant"]}
