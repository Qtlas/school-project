The vulnerability is due to improper resource management during CAPWAP message processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high volume of legitimate wireless management frames within a short time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition for clients associated with the AP.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1540", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1540_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1560", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1560_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1850_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_2800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_2800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_4800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_4800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9100", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9100_firmware"]}
