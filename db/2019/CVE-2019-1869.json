{"CVE": "CVE-2019-1869", "CWE": ["CWE-824"], "DATE": "2019-06-20T03:15:11", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Cisco StarOS Denial of Service Vulnerability", "DESC": "A vulnerability in the internal packet-processing functionality of the Cisco StarOS operating system running on virtual platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service interface from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected interface. The device may have to be manually reloaded to recover from exploitation of this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_5000", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_5500", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_5700", "cisco$PRODUCT$staros"]}
