{"CVE": "CVE-2019-1914", "CWE": ["CWE-20"], "DATE": "2019-08-07T06:15:12", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches Command Injection Vulnerability", "DESC": "A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts of the web management interface. To send the malicious request, the attacker needs a valid login session in the web management interface as a privilege level 15 user. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the root user.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf-220-24", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf-220-24_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-24p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-24p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28mp", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28mp_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-52", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-52_firmware"]}
