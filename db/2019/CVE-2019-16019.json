The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9000", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9010", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9904", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9910", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9912", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9922", "cisco$PRODUCT$carrier_routing_system", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xrv_9000", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1001", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1002", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_1004", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5001", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5002", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5011", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_540", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_540l", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_5500", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_560", "cisco$PRODUCT$ncs_6000"]}
