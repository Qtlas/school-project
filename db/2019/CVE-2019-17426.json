For example, adding \"_bsontype\":\"a\" can sometimes interfere with a query filter. NOTE: this CVE is about Mongoose's failure to work around this _bsontype special case that exists in older versions of the bson parser (aka the mongodb/js-bson project).", "PRODUIT": ["mongoosejs", "mongoosejs$PRODUCT$mongoose"]}
