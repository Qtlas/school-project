To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin) and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check.", "PRODUIT": "canonical"}
