This issue is exploitable only during the installation of the product by an administrator. A local authenticated low privileged user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by staging a malicious DLL in the search path of the installer prior to its execution by a local administrator. This would cause loading of the malicious DLL, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator.", "VENDOR": ["dell", "dell$PRODUCT$encryption", "dell$PRODUCT$endpoint_security_suite_enterprise"]}
