The vulnerability is due to a failure to free system memory when an unexpected DHCP request is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
