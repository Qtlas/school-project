The vulnerability is due to improper processing of transient SIP packets on which NAT is performed on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using UDP port 5060 to send crafted SIP packets through an affected device that is performing NAT for SIP packets. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-8p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101-4p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109-2p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109-4p", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x-8p", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$csr_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$encs_5100", "cisco$PRODUCT$encs_5400", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe", "cisco$PRODUCT$isrv"]}
