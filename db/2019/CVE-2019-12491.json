To exploit the vulnerability an attacker has to have control of a single server on a given cloud (e.g. by renting one). From the source server, the attacker can craft any command and trigger the OnApp platform to execute that command with root privileges on a target server.", "VENDOR": ["onapp", "onapp$PRODUCT$onapp"]}
