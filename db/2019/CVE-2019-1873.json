The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) ingress packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS/SSL packet to an interface on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, which will result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A valid SSL or TLS session is required to exploit this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506h-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506h-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506w-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506w-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5508-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5508-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5516-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5516-x_firmware"]}
