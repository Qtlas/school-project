{"CVE": "CVE-2019-12929", "CWE": ["CWE-668", "CWE-78"], "DATE": "2019-06-24T11:15:09", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "The QMP guest_exec command in QEMU 4.0.0 and earlier is prone to OS command injection, which allows the attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been disputed as a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by trusted users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the internet, then it is an insecure configuration issue", "VENDOR": ["qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu"]}
