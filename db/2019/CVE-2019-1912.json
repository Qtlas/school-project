The vulnerability is due to incomplete authorization checks in the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts of the web management interface. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the configuration of an affected device or to inject a reverse shell. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches running firmware versions prior to 1.1.4.4 with the web management interface enabled. The web management interface is enabled via both HTTP and HTTPS by default.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf-220-24", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf-220-24_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-24p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-24p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sf220-48p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-26p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28mp", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-28mp_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50p", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-50p_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-52", "cisco$PRODUCT$sg220-52_firmware"]}
