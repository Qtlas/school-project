The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain MPLS OAM packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS OAM packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the lspv_server process to crash. The crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic though the device, resulting in a DoS condition that require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9001", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9010", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9901", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9904", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9906", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9910", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9912", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9922", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr"]}
