The crash report could then be read by that user either by causing it to be uploaded and reported to Launchpad, or by leveraging some other vulnerability to read the resulting crash report, and so allow the user to read arbitrary files on the system.", "VENDOR": ["apport_project", "apport_project$PRODUCT$apport", "canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux"]}
