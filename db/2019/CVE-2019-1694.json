The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of TCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of packets at a high rate through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily disrupt traffic through the device while it reboots.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5510", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5520", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5540", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5550", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
