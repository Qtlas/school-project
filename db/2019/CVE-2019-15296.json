The faad_resetbits function in libfaad/bits.c is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability. The number of bits to be read is determined by ld->buffer_size - words*4, cast to uint32. If ld->buffer_size - words*4 is negative, a buffer overflow is later performed via getdword_n(&ld->start[words], ld->bytes_left).", "PRODUIT": ["audiocoding", "audiocoding$PRODUCT$freeware_advanced_audio_decoder_2", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
