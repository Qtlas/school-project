The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanity checks on an internal data structure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of malicious SIP messages to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a crash of the iosd process. This triggers a reload of the device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1000_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4000_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4321_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4351_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4451-x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1000", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-hx", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-hx", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$cloud_services_router_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$integrated_services_virtual_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
