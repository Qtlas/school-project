The SMB2 packet signing is not enforced if an admin configured \"server signing = required\" or for SMB2 connections to Domain Controllers where SMB2 packet signing is mandatory. This flaw allows an attacker to perform attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle attack, by intercepting the network traffic and modifying the SMB2 messages between client and server, affecting the integrity of the data.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$storage", "samba", "samba$PRODUCT$samba"]}
