Referencing the input_dev would lead to a\nuse-after-free when the input_dev was unregistered and subsequently fires a\nuevent that depends on the name. At the point of firing the uevent, the\nname would be freed by devres management.\n\nUse devm_kasprintf to simplify the logic for allocating memory and\nformatting the input_dev name string.", "VENDOR": []}
