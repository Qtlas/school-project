Effected devices have been mitigated through an automatic update beyond the affected range.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$nest_hub", "google$PRODUCT$nest_hub_firmware", "google$PRODUCT$nest_hub_max", "google$PRODUCT$nest_hub_max_firmware", "google$PRODUCT$nest_wifi_6e", "google$PRODUCT$nest_wifi_6e_firmware", "google$PRODUCT$nest_wifi_point", "google$PRODUCT$nest_wifi_point_firmware", "google$PRODUCT$wifi", "google$PRODUCT$wifi_firmware"]}
