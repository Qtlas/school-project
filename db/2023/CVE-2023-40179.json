Prior to version 1.3.6, the Password Recovery form would throw an error if the specified email was not found in our database. It would only display the \"Enter the code\" form if the email is associated with a member of the site. Since version 1.3.6, the \"Enter the code\" form is always returned, showing the message \"If the entered email is associated with an account, a code will be sent now\". This change prevents potential violators from determining if our site has a user with the specified email.", "VENDOR": ["silverwaregames", "silverwaregames$PRODUCT$silverwaregames"]}
