The attacker can abuse this functionality by launching this activity and then sending a broadcast with the \"com.lge.message.action.QCLIP\" action. The attacker can send, e.g., their own data/clipdata and set Intent.FLAG_GRANT_* flags. After the attacker received that intent in the \"onActivityResult()\" method, they would have access to arbitrary content providers that have the `android:grantUriPermissions=\"true\"` flag set.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$android", "lg", "lg$PRODUCT$v60_thin_q_5g"]}
