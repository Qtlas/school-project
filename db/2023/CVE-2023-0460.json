This allows the client app to remotely load code from YouTube Main App by retrieving the Main App\u2019s ClassLoader. A\u00a0potential vulnerability in the binding logic used by the client SDK where the SDK ends up calling bindService()\u00a0on a malicious app rather than YT Main App. This creates a vulnerability where the SDK can load the malicious app\u2019s ClassLoader instead, allowing the malicious app to load arbitrary code into the calling app whenever the embedded SDK is invoked.\n\nIn order to trigger this vulnerability, an attacker must masquerade the Youtube app and install it on a device, have a second app that uses the Embedded player and typically distribute both to the victim outside of the Play Store.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$youtube_android_player_api"]}
