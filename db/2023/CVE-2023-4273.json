The vulnerability exists in the implementation of the file name reconstruction function, which is responsible for reading file name entries from a directory index and merging file name parts belonging to one file into a single long file name. Since the file name characters are copied into a stack variable, a local privileged attacker could use this flaw to overflow the kernel stack.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s_firmware", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
