This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to get post listings by category as long as those posts are published. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin relying on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce being accessible to all authenticated users regardless of role.", "VENDOR": ["joomunited", "joomunited$PRODUCT$wp_meta_seo"]}
