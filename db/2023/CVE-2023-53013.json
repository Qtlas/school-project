The code flow\nin this function can lead down to pt_core_execute_cmd() which\nwill attempt to grab a mutex, which is not appropriate in\ninterrupt context and ultimately leads to a kernel panic.\nThe fix here changes this mutex to a spinlock, which has\nbeen verified to resolve the issue.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
