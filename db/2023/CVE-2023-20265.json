This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_110", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_110_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_210", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_dect_210_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_ip_phone_6901", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_ip_phone_6901_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_sip_phone_3905", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_sip_phone_3905_firmware"]}
