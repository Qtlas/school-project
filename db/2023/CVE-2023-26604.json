Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "systemd_project", "systemd_project$PRODUCT$systemd"]}
