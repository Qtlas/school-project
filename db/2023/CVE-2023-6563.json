It can be triggered in environments which have millions of offline tokens (> 500,000 users with each having at least 2 saved sessions). If an attacker creates two or more user sessions and then open the \"consents\" tab of the admin User Interface, the UI attempts to load a huge number of offline client sessions leading to excessive memory and CPU consumption which could potentially crash the entire system.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$keycloak", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform_for_ibm_linuxone", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform_for_power", "redhat$PRODUCT$single_sign-on"]}
