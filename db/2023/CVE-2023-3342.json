This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This was partially patched in version 3.0.2 and fully patched in version 3.0.2.1.", "VENDOR": ["wpeverest", "wpeverest$PRODUCT$user_registration"]}
