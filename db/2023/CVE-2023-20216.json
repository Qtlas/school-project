A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands beyond the sphere of their intended access level, including initiating installs or running operating system commands with elevated permissions.\r\n\r   There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_application_delivery_platform", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_application_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_database_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_execution_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_media_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_network_database_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_network_function_manager", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_network_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_profile_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_service_control_function_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_troubleshooting_server", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_xtended_services_platform"]}
