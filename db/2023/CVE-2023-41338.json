Versions of gofiber prior to 2.49.2 did not properly restrict access to localhost. This issue impacts users of our project who rely on the `ctx.IsFromLocal` method to restrict access to localhost requests. If exploited, it could allow unauthorized access to resources intended only for localhost. Setting `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` in a request from a foreign host, will result in true for `ctx.IsFromLocal`. Access is limited to the scope of the affected process. This issue has been patched in version `2.49.2` with commit `b8c9ede6`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading to the patched version. ", "VENDOR": ["gofiber", "gofiber$PRODUCT$fiber"]}
