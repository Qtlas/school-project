In shutdown this\nrsi_config_wowlan() should only ever be called if WoWlan was configured\nbefore by the user.\n\nAdd checks for non-NULL wowlan_config into the shutdown hook. While at it,\ncheck whether the wiphy is also non-NULL before accessing wowlan_config .\nDrop the single-use wowlan_config variable, just inline it into function\ncall.", "VENDOR": []}
