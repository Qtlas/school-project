The usb_giveback_urb function has a logic loophole in its implementation. Due to the inappropriate judgment condition of the goto statement, the function cannot return under the input of a specific malformed descriptor file, so it falls into an endless loop, resulting in a denial of service.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
