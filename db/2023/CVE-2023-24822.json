Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference while encoding a 6LoWPAN IPHC header. The NULL pointer dereference causes a hard fault exception, leading to denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patches manually.", "VENDOR": ["riot-os", "riot-os$PRODUCT$riot"]}
