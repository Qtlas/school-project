Setting off to a unexpectetly large\nvalue will cause the sum with len and 8 to overflow and pass\nthe implemented validation step. Consequently the response\npointer will be referring to a location past the expected\nbuffer boundaries allowing information leakage e.g. via\nRNDIS_OID_802_3_PERMANENT_ADDRESS OID.", "VENDOR": []}
