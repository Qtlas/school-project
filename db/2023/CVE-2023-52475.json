This\nhappens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from\nthe powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message\ncompletes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not\nexist anymore and hence the bug.\n\nUse usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon\ndevice disconnection.\n\n[1] https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=0434ac83f907a1dbdd1e", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
