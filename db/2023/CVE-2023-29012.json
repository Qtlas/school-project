Prior to version 2.40.1, any user of Git CMD who starts the command in an untrusted directory is impacted by an Uncontrolles Search Path Element vulnerability. Maliciously-placed `doskey.exe` would be executed silently upon running Git CMD. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, avoid using Git CMD or, if using Git CMD, avoid starting it in an untrusted directory.", "VENDOR": ["git_for_windows_project", "git_for_windows_project$PRODUCT$git_for_windows"]}
