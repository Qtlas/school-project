It is possible to bypass the existing security measures put in place to avoid open redirect by using a redirect such as `//mydomain.com` (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible to bypass it when using URL such as `http:/mydomain.com`. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.4 and 14.8RC1.\n", "PRODUIT": ["xwiki", "xwiki$PRODUCT$xwiki"]}
