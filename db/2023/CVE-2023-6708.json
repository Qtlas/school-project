This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note that successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the administrator to allow author-level users to upload SVG files.", "VENDOR": []}
