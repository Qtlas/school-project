Such web interface lacks authentication and may thus be abused by a local attacker or malware running on the machine itself.\n\n\n\nA malicious local user or process, during a window of opportunity when the local web interface is active, may be able to extract sensitive information or change Arc's configuration. This could also lead to arbitrary code execution if a malicious update package is installed.", "VENDOR": []}
