The library contains critical security issues and should not be used for production. The maintenance of the project has been discontinued. In vm2 for versions up to 3.9.19, `Promise` handler sanitization can be bypassed with the `@@species` accessor property allowing attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code, potentially allowing remote code execution inside the context of vm2 sandbox. Version 3.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "PRODUIT": "vm2_project"}
