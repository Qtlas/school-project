An attacker with an on-path position between the ACI sites could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting intersite encrypted traffic and using cryptanalytic techniques to break the encryption. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify the traffic that is transmitted between the sites.\r\n\r Cisco has not released and will not release software updates that address this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9000_in_aci_mode", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os"]}
