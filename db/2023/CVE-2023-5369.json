Using an offset is logically equivalent to seeking, and the system call must additionally require the CAP_SEEK capability.\n\nThis incorrect privilege check enabled sandboxed processes with only read or write but no seek capability on a file descriptor to read data from or write data to an arbitrary location within the file corresponding to that file descriptor.", "VENDOR": ["freebsd", "freebsd$PRODUCT$freebsd"]}
