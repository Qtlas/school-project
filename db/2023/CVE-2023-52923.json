Async GC enqueues transaction work that might be\naborted and retried later.\n\nrbtree and pipapo set backends does not set on the _DEAD bit from the\nsync GC path since this runs in control plane path where mutex is held.\nIn this case, set elements are deactivated, removed and then released\nvia RCU callback, sync GC never fails.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
