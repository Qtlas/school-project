This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries leading to resource exhaustion via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Version 3.3.18 addresses the SQL Injection, which drastically reduced the severity.", "VENDOR": ["themeisle", "themeisle$PRODUCT$multiple_page_generator"]}
