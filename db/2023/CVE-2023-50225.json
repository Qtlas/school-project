This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link TL-WR902AC routers. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the libcmm.so module. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-21819.", "VENDOR": ["tp-link", "tp-link$PRODUCT$tl-wr902ac", "tp-link$PRODUCT$tl-wr902ac_firmware"]}
