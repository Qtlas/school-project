Users of Budibase cloud need to take no action. Self-host users who run Budibase on the public internet and are using a cloud provider that allows HTTP access to metadata information should ensure that when they deploy Budibase live, their internal metadata endpoint is not exposed.", "VENDOR": ["budibase", "budibase$PRODUCT$budibase"]}
