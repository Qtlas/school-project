Add call to\nnapi_consume_skb to properly free SKBs.\n\nAnother leak was happening because mlx5e_skb_fifo_has_room() had an error\nin the check. Comparing free running counters works well unless C promotes\nthe types to something wider than the counter. In this case counters are\nu16 but the result of the substraction is promouted to int and it causes\nwrong result (negative value) of the check when producer have already\noverlapped but consumer haven't yet. Explicit cast to u16 fixes the issue.", "VENDOR": []}
