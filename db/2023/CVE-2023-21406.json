A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the pacsiod process which\nis handling the OSDP communication allowing to write outside of the allocated buffer. By\nappending invalid data to an OSDP message it was possible to write data beyond the heap\nallocated buffer. The data written outside the buffer could be used to execute arbitrary code.\u00a0\n\nlease refer to the Axis security advisory for more information, mitigation and affected products and software versions.", "PRODUIT": ["axis", "axis$PRODUCT$a1001", "axis$PRODUCT$a1001_firmware"]}
