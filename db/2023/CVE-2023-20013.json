The attacker would need to have Administrator privileges on the affected device to exploit these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation when extracting uploaded software packages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to an affected device and uploading a crafted software package. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$intersight_private_virtual_appliance"]}
