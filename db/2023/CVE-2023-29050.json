Unauthorized users could break confidentiality of information in the directory and potentially cause high load on the directory server, leading to denial of service. Encoding has been added for user-provided fragments that are used when constructing the LDAP query. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "PRODUIT": "open-xchange"}
