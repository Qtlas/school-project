This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "golang", "golang$PRODUCT$go"]}
