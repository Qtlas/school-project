This could also allow them to read non PHP files and retrieve their content. RCE could also be achieved if the attacker manage to upload a malicious image containing PHP code, and then include it via the affected attribute, on a default WP install, authors could easily achieve that given that they have the upload_file capability.", "VENDOR": ["cusrev", "cusrev$PRODUCT$customer_reviews_for_woocommerce"]}
