This issue may allow an attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS filesystem image, leading to grub's heap metadata corruption. In some circumstances, the attack may also corrupt the UEFI firmware heap metadata. As a result, arbitrary code execution and secure boot protection bypass may be achieved.", "VENDOR": ["gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$grub2", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
