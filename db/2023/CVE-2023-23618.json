Prior to Git for Windows version 2.39.2, when `gitk` is run on Windows, it potentially runs executables from the current directory inadvertently, which can be exploited with some social engineering to trick users into running untrusted code. A patch is available in version 2.39.2. As a workaround, avoid using `gitk` (or Git GUI's \"Visualize History\" functionality) in clones of untrusted repositories.\n", "PRODUIT": "git_for_windows_project"}
