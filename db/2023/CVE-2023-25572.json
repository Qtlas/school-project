{"CVE": "CVE-2023-25572", "CWE": ["CWE-79"], "DATE": "2023-02-13T21:15:15", "CVSS": 5.4, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "React-Admin vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting attack on `<RichTextField>`", "DESC": "react-admin is a frontend framework for building browser applications on top of REST/GraphQL APIs. react-admin prior to versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6, along with ra-ui-materialui prior to 3.19.12 and 4.7.6, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. All React applications built with react-admin and using the `<RichTextField>` are affected. `<RichTextField>` outputs the field value using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without client-side sanitization. If the data isn't sanitized server-side, this opens a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 now use `DOMPurify` to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Users who already sanitize HTML data server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround, users may replace the `<RichTextField>` by a custom field doing sanitization by hand.\n", "VENDOR": ["marmelab", "marmelab$PRODUCT$ra-ui-materialui", "marmelab$PRODUCT$react-admin"]}
