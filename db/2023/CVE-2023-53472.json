On basis of this fact\nsimplify the code by removing operations with pwm->hwpwm, there is no\ncontrols which require channel number as input.\n\nEven though I wasn't aware at the time when I forward ported that patch,\nthis fixes a null pointer dereference as lpc32xx->chip.pwms is NULL\nbefore devm_pwmchip_add() is called.", "VENDOR": []}
