This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to\ndifferent and unrelated sites and domains.\n\nIt could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that\nverifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For\nexample a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a lower\ncase hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL domain.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$curl"]}
