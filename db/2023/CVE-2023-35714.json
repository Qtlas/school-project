This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of IGS files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read before the start of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-18005.", "PRODUIT": ["ashlar", "ashlar$PRODUCT$cobalt"]}
