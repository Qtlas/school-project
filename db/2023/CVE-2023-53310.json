So there is a window\nwhere fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() may get called while\ninfo->bat has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed\nthe power_supply which will eventually get stored in info->bat,\nso fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() can simply directly use\nthe passed in psy argument which is always valid.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
