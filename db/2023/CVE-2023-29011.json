{"CVE": "CVE-2023-29011", "CWE": ["CWE-427"], "DATE": "2023-04-25 21:15:10", "SCORE": 7.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Git for Windows's config file of `connect.exe` is susceptible to malicious placing", "DESC": "Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, ships with an executable called `connect.exe`, which implements a SOCKS5 proxy that can be used to connect e.g. to SSH servers via proxies when certain ports are blocked for outgoing connections. The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\\etc\\connectrc`. Since `C:\\etc` can be created by any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively, watch out for malicious `<drive>:\\etc\\connectrc` files on multi-user machines.", "PRODUIT": "git_for_windows_project"}
