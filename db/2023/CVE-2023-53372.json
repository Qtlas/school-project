However, the data left for\nthe last pos may be < sizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip), and dereference\nit as struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip may cause coverflow.\n\nThis patch fixes it by checking the pos against \"the end of the chunk -\nsizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip)\" in sctp_ifwdtsn_skip, similar to\nsctp_fwdtsn_skip.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
