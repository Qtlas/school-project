In Panindex prior to version 3.1.3,  a hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded JWT key to sign JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges.

As a workaround, one may change the JWT key in the source code before compiling the project.\n  \n", "PRODUIT": ["panindex_project", "panindex_project$PRODUCT$panindex"]}
