If ish_probe() fails, the devm-managed device resources\nincluding ishtp_dev are freed, but the work is not cancelled, causing a\nuse-after-free when the work function tries to access ishtp_dev. Use\ndevm_work_autocancel() instead, so that the work is automatically\ncancelled if probe fails.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
