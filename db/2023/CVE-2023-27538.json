However, two SSH settings were omitted from the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.", "VENDOR": ["broadcom", "broadcom$PRODUCT$brocade_fabric_operating_system_firmware", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$libcurl", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$clustered_data_ontap", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s_firmware", "splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$universal_forwarder"]}
