This means\nthe route lookup is subject to preemption, resulting in an potential\ngrace period expiry, and so an eventual kfree() while we still have the\nroute pointer.\n\nAdd the proper read-side critical section locks around the route\nlookups, preventing premption and a possible parallel kfree.\n\nThe remaining net->mctp.routes accesses are already under a\nrcu_read_lock, or protected by the RTNL for updates.\n\nBased on an analysis from Sili Luo <rootlab@huawei.com>, where\nintroducing a delay in the route lookup could cause a UAF on\nsimultaneous sendmsg() and route deletion.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
