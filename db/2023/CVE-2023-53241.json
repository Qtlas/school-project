This could cause a\nmemory leak in the layoutget codepath if there is an error at an\ninopportune time.\n\nHave the compound processing engine always call op_release, even when\nop_func sets an error in op->status. With this change, we also need\nnfsd4_block_get_device_info_scsi to set the gd_device pointer to NULL\non error to avoid a double free.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
