This avoids a possible out-of-bounds access on the pivot\narray if the write extends to the last slot in the node, in which case the\nnode maximum should be used as the end pivot.\n\nakpm: this doesn't affect any current callers, but new users of mapletree\nmay encounter this problem if backported into earlier kernels, so let's\nfix it in -stable kernels in case of this.", "VENDOR": []}
