Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the latter. The issue seems to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)` as in loops of type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the variable. The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.", "PRODUIT": ["vyperlang", "vyperlang$PRODUCT$vyper"]}
