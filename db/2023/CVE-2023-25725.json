For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the impact is limited because the headers disappear before being parsed and processed, as if they had not been sent by the client. The fixed versions are 2.7.3, 2.6.9, 2.5.12, 2.4.22, 2.2.29, and 2.0.31.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "haproxy", "haproxy$PRODUCT$haproxy"]}
