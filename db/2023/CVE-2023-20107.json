This vulnerability is due to insufficient entropy in the DRBG for the affected hardware platforms when generating cryptographic keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number of cryptographic keys on an affected device and looking for collisions with target devices. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate an affected target device or to decrypt traffic secured by an affected key that is sent to or from an affected target device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506h-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5506w-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5508-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5516-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
