This is due to the fact that during menu item deletion/modification, the plugin does not verify that the post ID provided to the AJAX action is indeed a menu item. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher, to modify or delete arbitrary posts.", "VENDOR": ["thingsforrestaurants", "thingsforrestaurants$PRODUCT$quick_restaurant_menu"]}
