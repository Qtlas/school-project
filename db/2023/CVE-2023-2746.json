To exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would have to convince a user to click on an untrusted link through a social engineering attack or successfully perform a Cross Site Scripting Attack (XSS). Exploitation of a CSRF could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure and full remote access to the affected products.\n\n\n\n\n", "VENDOR": ["rockwellautomation", "rockwellautomation$PRODUCT$enhanced_him"]}
