It will ensure the attribute being described produces\na valid nlattr pointer in info->attrs before entering into each handler\nin vdpa_nl_ops.\n\nThat is to say, the missing part in vdpa_nl_policy may lead to illegal\nnlattr after parsing, which could lead to OOB read just like CVE-2023-3773.\n\nThis patch adds the missing nla_policy for vdpa max vqp attr to avoid\nsuch bugs.", "VENDOR": []}
