An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of SSL/TLS traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected error in the hardware-based cryptography engine, which could cause the device to reload.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2110", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2130", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
