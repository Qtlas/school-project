After successfully authenticating with any other account the previous session would be continued and the attacker would be authenticated as the previously logged in user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 25.0.6 or 26.0.1.", "VENDOR": ["nextcloud", "nextcloud$PRODUCT$nextcloud_server"]}
