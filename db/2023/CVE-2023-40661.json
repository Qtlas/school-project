To take advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially allow \r\ncompromise key generation, certificate loading, and other card management operations during enrollment.", "VENDOR": ["opensc_project", "opensc_project$PRODUCT$opensc", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
