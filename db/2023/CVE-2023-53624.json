It's not an infinite loop,\nbut \"credit\" wasn't probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow.\nCapping \"initial quantum\" to INT_MAX proved to fix the issue.\n\nv2: validation of \"initial quantum\" is done in fq_policy, instead of open\n    coding in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski", "VENDOR": []}
