FTD management traffic is not affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to improper error checking when parsing fields within the ICMPv6 header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ICMPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust CPU resources and stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: To recover from the DoS condition, the Snort 2 Detection Engine or the Cisco FTD device may need to be restarted.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
