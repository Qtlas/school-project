These enrolment tokens could allow someone to enrol an agent into an agent policy, and potentially use that to retrieve other secrets in the policy including for Elasticsearch and third-party services. Alternatively a threat actor could potentially enrol agents to the clusters and send arbitrary events to Elasticsearch.", "VENDOR": ["elastic", "elastic$PRODUCT$fleet_server"]}
