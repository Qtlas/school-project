This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ansys SpaceClaim. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of X_B files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-17827.", "VENDOR": ["ansys", "ansys$PRODUCT$spaceclaim"]}
