Attackers with access to user accounts could use this to bypass existing deny-list functionality and trigger requests to restricted network infrastructure to gain insight about topology and running services. We now respect possible IPV4-mapped IPv6 addresses when checking if contained in a deny-list. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "VENDOR": ["open-xchange", "open-xchange$PRODUCT$open-xchange_appsuite_backend"]}
