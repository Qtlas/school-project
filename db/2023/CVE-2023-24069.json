Cached attachments are not effectively cleared. In some cases, even after a self-initiated file deletion, an attacker can still recover the file if it was previously replied to in a conversation. (Local filesystem access is needed by the attacker.) NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this finding because the product is not intended to protect against adversaries with this degree of local access.", "PRODUIT": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "signal", "signal$PRODUCT$signal-desktop"]}
