It replaces the less informative WARN_ON_ONCE\nbacktraces with a new error handling method. This provides clearer error\nmessages and allows for the early termination of problematic sessions.\nPreviously, sessions were only released at the end of j1939_xtp_rx_rts().\n\nPotentially this could be reproduced with something like:\ntestj1939 -r vcan0:0x80 &\nwhile true; do\n\t# send first RTS\n\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;\n\t# send second RTS\n\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;\n\t# send abort\n\tcansend vcan0 18EC8090#ff00000000002301;\ndone", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
