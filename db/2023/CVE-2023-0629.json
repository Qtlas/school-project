This would not affect already running containers, nor containers launched through the usual approach (without Docker's raw socket).\n\nThe affected functionality is available for Docker Business customers only and assumes an environment where users are not granted local root or Administrator privileges.\nThis issue has been fixed in Docker Desktop 4.17.0. \n\nAffected Docker Desktop versions: from 4.13.0 before 4.17.0.\n\n", "VENDOR": ["docker", "docker$PRODUCT$docker_desktop"]}
