If it is built to use the synchronous resolver, it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using `alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`. When doing this, libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex protected and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or otherwise misbehave.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$curl", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$clustered_data_ontap", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$ontap_antivirus_connector"]}
