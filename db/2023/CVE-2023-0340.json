This could also allow them to read non PHP files and retrieve their content. RCE could also be achieved if the attacker manage to upload a malicious image containing PHP code, and then include it via the affected attribute, on a default WP install, authors could easily achieve that given that they have the upload_file capability.", "PRODUIT": ["custom_content_shortcode_project", "custom_content_shortcode_project$PRODUCT$custom_content_shortcode"]}
