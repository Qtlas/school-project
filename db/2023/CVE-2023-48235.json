Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "vim", "vim$PRODUCT$vim"]}
