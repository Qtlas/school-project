OpenAM up to version 14.7.2 does not properly validate the signature of SAML responses received as part of the SAMLv1.x Single Sign-On process. Attackers can use this fact to impersonate any OpenAM user, including the administrator, by sending a specially crafted SAML response to the SAMLPOSTProfileServlet servlet. This problem has been patched in  OpenAM 14.7.3-SNAPSHOT and later. User unable to upgrade should comment servlet `SAMLPOSTProfileServlet` from their pom file. See the linked GHSA for details.", "VENDOR": ["openidentityplatform", "openidentityplatform$PRODUCT$openam"]}
