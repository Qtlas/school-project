However, mac80211\nwill not automatically stop the queue. If we don't manually stop the\nbeacon queue, the queue will be deadlocked and unable to start again.\nThis patch fixes the issue where Apple devices cannot connect to the\nAP after calling ieee80211_restart_hw().", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
