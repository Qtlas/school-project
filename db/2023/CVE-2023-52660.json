If such a call happens while the ISP\nis powered down, the SoC will hang as the driver tries to access the\nISP registers.\n\nThis can be reproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line:\nEnable CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ and unload the driver, and the board will\nhang.\n\nFix this by adding a new field, 'irqs_enabled', which is used to bail\nout from the interrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
