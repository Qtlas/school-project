This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$evolved_programmable_network_manager", "cisco$PRODUCT$prime_infrastructure"]}
