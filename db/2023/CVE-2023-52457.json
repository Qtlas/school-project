This will be ignored.\n\nand then remove the device anyhow. So all resources that were not freed\nare leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port() has the\npotential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-free.\n\nSo replace the error return (and with it the little helpful error\nmessage) by a more useful error message and continue to cleanup.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
