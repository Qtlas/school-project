This issue may happen if there is insufficient memory or the memory usage is limited. The problem is caused by the return value `rc,` which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The value of the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification. Therefore any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "libssh", "libssh$PRODUCT$libssh", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
