In the first\ncheck, 'need_replace' will be set and 'mreplace' will be used later if\nno-Faulty 'mreplace' exists, In the second check, 'mreplace' will be\nset to NULL if it is Faulty, but 'need_replace' will not be changed\naccordingly. null-ptr-deref occurs if Faulty is set between two check.\n\nFix it by merging two checks into one. And replace 'need_replace' with\n'mreplace' because their values are always the same.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
