Additionally, if Apache Superset is using a SQLite database for its metadata (not advised for production use) it could result in more severe vulnerabilities related to confidentiality and integrity.\u00a0This vulnerability exists in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.1.0.", "PRODUIT": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$superset"]}
