In versions 2023.01 and prior, an attacker can send a crafted frame which is forwarded by the device. During encoding of the packet a NULL pointer dereference occurs. This crashes the device leading to denial of service. A patch is available at pull request 19678. There are no known workarounds.", "VENDOR": ["riot-os", "riot-os$PRODUCT$riot"]}
