A vulnerability in versions 1.0.0 until 1.3.0 effectively allowed an attacker to bypass the state protection as they could just copy the expected state token from the first request to their second request. Users should upgrade user_oidc to 1.3.0 to receive a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "PRODUIT": "nextcloud"}
