This happens because the large value is set without any\nvalidation in dbMount() at line 181.\n\nThus, make sure that db_l2nbperpage is correct while mounting.\n\nMax number of blocks per page = Page size / Min block size\n=> log2(Max num_block per page) = log2(Page size / Min block size)\n\t\t\t\t= log2(Page size) - log2(Min block size)\n\n=> Max db_l2nbperpage = L2PSIZE - L2MINBLOCKSIZE", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
