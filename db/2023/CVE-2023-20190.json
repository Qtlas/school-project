An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting.\r\n\r   There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r   \r\n\r \r This advisory is part of the September 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
