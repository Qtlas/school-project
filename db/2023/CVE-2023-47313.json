The application uses an API call to move the uploaded temporary file to the file directory during the file upload process. This API call receives two input parameters, such as path and localPath. The first one refers to the temporary file with an absolute path without validating it. Attackers may modify this API call by referring to arbitrary files. As a result, arbitrary files can be moved to the files directory and so they can be downloaded.", "PRODUIT": ["h-mdm", "h-mdm$PRODUCT$headwind_mdm"]}
