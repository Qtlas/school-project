This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This required WP_DEBUG to be enabled in order to be exploited.", "VENDOR": ["instawp", "instawp$PRODUCT$string_locator"]}
