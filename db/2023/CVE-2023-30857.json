Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue has been patched in version `0.6.1`.\n", "VENDOR": ["aedart", "aedart$PRODUCT$ion"]}
