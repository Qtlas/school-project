These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_firmware"]}
