In versions priot to 1.5.2 trying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks.\nIf you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic. This is caused by bogus fanout parameter in the HAMT directory nodes. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["protocol", "protocol$PRODUCT$go-unixfsnode"]}
