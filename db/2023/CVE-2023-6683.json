The qemu_clipboard_request() function can be reached before vnc_server_cut_text_caps() was called and had the chance to initialize the clipboard peer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. This could allow a malicious authenticated VNC client to crash QEMU and trigger a denial of service.", "VENDOR": ["qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
