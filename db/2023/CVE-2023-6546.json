This issue occurs when two threads execute the GSMIOC_SETCONF ioctl on the same tty file descriptor with the gsm line discipline enabled, and can lead to a use-after-free problem on a struct gsm_dlci while restarting the gsm mux. This could allow a local unprivileged user to escalate their privileges on the system.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
