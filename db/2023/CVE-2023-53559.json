Then,\nslab-use-after-free may occur when ip_vti device sends IPv6 packets.\nAs commit f855691975bb (\"xfrm6: Fix the nexthdr offset in\n_decode_session6.\") showed, xfrm_decode_session was originally intended\nonly for the receive path. IP6CB(skb)->nhoff is not set during\ntransmission. Therefore, set the cb field in the skb to 0 before\nsending packets.", "VENDOR": []}
