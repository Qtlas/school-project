This passes a NULL\npointer to iounmap(), which can trigger a WARN() on certain arches.\n\nWhen if_type equals six and pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_64BIT_BAR4)\nreturns true, drbl_regs_memmap_p may has been remapped and\nctrl_regs_memmap_p is not remapped. This is a resource leak and passes a\nNULL pointer to iounmap().\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to add null checks before iounmap(), and\nchange some goto labels.", "VENDOR": []}
