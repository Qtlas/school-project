An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid low-privileged SSH key to an affected device from a host that has an IP address that is configured as the source for a high-privileged user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected device through SSH as a high-privileged user.\r\n\r   There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_5000", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_5500", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_5700", "cisco$PRODUCT$staros", "cisco$PRODUCT$vpc-di", "cisco$PRODUCT$vpc-si"]}
