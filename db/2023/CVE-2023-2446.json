This is due to insufficient restriction on sensitive user meta values that can be called via that shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions, and above to retrieve sensitive user meta that can be used to gain access to a high privileged user account.", "VENDOR": ["userproplugin", "userproplugin$PRODUCT$userpro"]}
