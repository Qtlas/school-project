The Vega `scale` expression function has the ability to call arbitrary functions with a single controlled argument. The scale expression function passes a user supplied argument group to getScale, which is then used as if it were an internal context. The context.scales[name].value is accessed from group and called as a function back in scale. This can be exploited to escape the Vega expression sandbox in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript. This issue has been fixed in version 5.13.1.", "VENDOR": ["vega-functions_project", "vega-functions_project$PRODUCT$vega-functions", "vega_project", "vega_project$PRODUCT$vega"]}
