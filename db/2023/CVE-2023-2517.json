This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the permalink_setup function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the permalink structure via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While nonce verification is implemented, verification only takes place when a nonce is provided.", "VENDOR": ["wpmet", "wpmet$PRODUCT$metform_elementor_contact_form_builder"]}
