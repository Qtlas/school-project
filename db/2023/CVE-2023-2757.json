This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions to save plugin data that can potentially lead to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "PRODUIT": ["plugin", "plugin$PRODUCT$waiting"]}
