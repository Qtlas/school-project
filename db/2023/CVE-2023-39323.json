This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when running \"go build\". The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which makes exploiting this issue significantly more complex.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "golang", "golang$PRODUCT$go"]}
