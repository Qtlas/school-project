Authorization codes were predictable for third parties and could be used to intercept and take over the client authorization process. As a result, other users accounts could be compromised. The oAuth Authorization Service is not enabled by default. We have updated the implementation to use sources with sufficient randomness to generate authorization tokens. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "VENDOR": ["open-xchange", "open-xchange$PRODUCT$open-xchange_appsuite_backend"]}
