When a local user in the guest writes an executable file with SUID or SGID, none of these privileged bits are correctly dropped. As a result, in rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by malicious users in the guest to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host local user to elevate privileges on the host.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu"]}
