So, if there are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext()\nto lanes sharing the same PCC register (either for the \"old\" or for the\n\"new\" protocol), corruption of the values programmed to hardware is\npossible, because lynx_28g_rmw() has no locking.\n\nAdd a spinlock in the struct lynx_28g_priv shared by all lanes, and take\nthe global spinlock from the phy_ops :: set_mode() implementation. There\nare no other callers which modify PCC registers.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
