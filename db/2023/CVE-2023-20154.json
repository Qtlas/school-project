An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web interface of an affected server. Under certain conditions, the authentication mechanism would be bypassed and the attacker would be logged in as an administrator. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain administrative privileges on the web interface of an affected server, including the ability to access and modify every simulation and all user-created data. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid user credentials that are stored on the associated external authentication server.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$modeling_labs"]}
