So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent\nand unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).\nSo using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.\n\nInstead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware\naccess and clk disable.\n\nAlso add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.\nThe latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by\nthe spi core.", "VENDOR": []}
