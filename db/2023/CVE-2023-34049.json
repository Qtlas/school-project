If an attacker has access to the target VM and knows the path to the pre-flight script before it runs they can ensure Salt-SSH runs their script with the privileges of the user running Salt-SSH.\u00a0Do not make the copy path on the target predictable and ensure we check return codes of the scp command if the copy fails.", "VENDOR": []}
