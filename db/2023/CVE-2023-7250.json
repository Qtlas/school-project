A malicious or malfunctioning client can send less than the expected amount of data to the iperf server, which can cause the server to hang indefinitely waiting for the remainder or until the connection gets closed. This will prevent other connections to the server, leading to a denial of service.", "VENDOR": ["es", "es$PRODUCT$iperf3", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_for_arm_64", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_for_ibm_z_systems", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_for_power_little_endian"]}
