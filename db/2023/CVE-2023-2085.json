This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to obtain plugin template information. While a nonce check is present, it is only executed when a nonce is provided. Not providing a nonce results in the nonce verification to be skipped. There is no capability check.", "VENDOR": ["wpdeveloper", "wpdeveloper$PRODUCT$essential_blocks"]}
