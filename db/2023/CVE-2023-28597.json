If a victim saves a local recording to an SMB location and later opens it using a link from Zoom\u2019s web portal, an attacker positioned on an adjacent network to the victim client could set up a malicious SMB server to respond to client requests, causing the client to execute attacker controlled executables. This could result in an attacker gaining access to a user's device and data, and remote code execution.", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "zoom", "zoom$PRODUCT$rooms", "zoom$PRODUCT$virtual_desktop_infrastructure", "zoom$PRODUCT$zoom"]}
