When using an SSH remote with the optional libssh2 backend, libgit2 does not perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions of libgit2 require the caller to set the `certificate_check` field of libgit2's `git_remote_callbacks` structure - if a certificate check callback is not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate checking. This means that by default - without configuring a certificate check callback, clients will not perform validation on the server SSH keys and may be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack. Users are encouraged to upgrade to v1.4.5 or v1.5.1. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that all relevant certificates are manually checked.", "PRODUIT": ["libgit2", "libgit2$PRODUCT$libgit2"]}
