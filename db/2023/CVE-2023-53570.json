The\ninteger overflow can lead to a heap buffer overflow as num_elems determines\nthe size of the trailing array in elems, and this array is thereafter\nwritten to for each element in attrs.\n\nNote that this vulnerability only affects devices with the\nwiphy->mbssid_max_interfaces member set for the wireless physical device\nstruct in the device driver, and can only be triggered by a process with\nCAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities.\n\nFix this by checking for a maximum of 255 elements in attrs.", "PRODUIT": ""}
