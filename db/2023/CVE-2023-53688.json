An attacker can submit crafted input that is not properly validated or escaped, allowing injection of malicious script that executes in the context of a victim's browser (XSS). Additionally, the component does not enforce sufficient anti-CSRF protections on state-changing operations, enabling an attacker to induce authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.", "PRODUIT": ["nagios", "nagios$PRODUCT$nagios_xi"]}
