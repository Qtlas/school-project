This issue can result in unauthorized login.\nNow we have fixed this issue and now user must have the correct login to access workbench.\nThis issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0.\u00a0We recommend that all submarine users with 0.7.0 upgrade to 0.8.0, which not only fixes the issue, supports the oidc authentication mode, but also removes the case of unauthenticated logins.\nIf using the version lower than 0.8.0 and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1037 https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054  and rebuild the submarine-server image to fix this.\n\n", "PRODUIT": "apache"}
