The wrong portion of an RFC2822 header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some applications, an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which application access is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). This occurs in email/_parseaddr.py in recent versions of Python.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$ontap_select_deploy_administration_utility", "python", "python$PRODUCT$python"]}
