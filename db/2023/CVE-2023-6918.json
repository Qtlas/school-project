The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "libssh", "libssh$PRODUCT$libssh", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
