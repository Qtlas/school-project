This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target in a guest system must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the virtio-gpu virtual device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-21260.", "VENDOR": ["parallels", "parallels$PRODUCT$parallels_desktop"]}
