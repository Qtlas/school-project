A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS, with the privileges of the vulnerable application. This is a high severity vulnerability as the exploitation allows an attacker to take complete control of a system, so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n", "VENDOR": ["dell", "dell$PRODUCT$networker", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
