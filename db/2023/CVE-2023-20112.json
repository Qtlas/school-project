This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain parameters within 802.11 frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a wireless 802.11 association request frame with crafted parameters to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_150ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_150ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_151axm", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_151axm_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105axi_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105axw", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105axw_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105i_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105w", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axe_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axi_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117axi_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axe_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axi_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axp", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axp_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124axd", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124axd_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124axi_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axe_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axi_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9136", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9136_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9162", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9162_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9164", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9164_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9166", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9166_firmware"]}
