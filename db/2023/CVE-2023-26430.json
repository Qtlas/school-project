This could be abused to access SIEVE extension that are not allowed by App Suite or to inject rules which would break per-user filter processing, requiring manual cleanup of such rules. We have added sanitization to all mail-filter APIs to avoid forwardning control characters to subsystems. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "VENDOR": ["open-xchange", "open-xchange$PRODUCT$open-xchange_appsuite_backend"]}
