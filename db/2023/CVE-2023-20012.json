This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the console port on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and execute a limited set of commands local to the FEX, which could cause a device reboot and denial of service (DoS) condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93180yc-fx3", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93180yc-fx3_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93180yc-fx3s", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93180yc-fx3s_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_64108", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_64108_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6454", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6454_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6536", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6536_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_central_software"]}
