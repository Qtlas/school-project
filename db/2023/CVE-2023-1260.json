This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker who has been given permissions \"update, patch\" the \"pods/ephemeralcontainers\" subresource beyond what the default is. They would then need to create a new pod or patch one that they already have access to. This might allow evasion of SCC admission restrictions, thereby gaining control of a privileged pod.", "PRODUIT": ["kubernetes", "kubernetes$PRODUCT$kube-apiserver", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform"]}
