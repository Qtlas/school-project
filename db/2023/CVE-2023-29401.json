A maliciously crafted filename can cause the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header. For example, a filename of \"setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt\" will be sent as a file named \"setup.bat\". If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.", "PRODUIT": ["gin-gonic", "gin-gonic$PRODUCT$gin"]}
