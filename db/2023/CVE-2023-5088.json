This could be used, for example, by L2 guests with a virtual disk (vdiskL2) stored on a virtual disk of an L1 (vdiskL1) hypervisor to read and/or write data to LBA 0 of vdiskL1, potentially gaining control of L1 at its next reboot.", "VENDOR": ["qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
