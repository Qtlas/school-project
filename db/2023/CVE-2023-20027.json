This vulnerability is due to improper reassembly of large packets that occurs when VFR is enabled on either a tunnel interface or on a physical interface that is configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) greater than 4,615 bytes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets through a VFR-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1000_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4g\\/6g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4p_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-6g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-8p_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101-4p_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109-2p_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109-4p_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x-8p_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1120_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1131_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1160_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4321_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4351_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4451-x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4461_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$c8200-1n-4t", "cisco$PRODUCT$c8200l-1n-4t", "cisco$PRODUCT$c8500l-8s4x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8000v_edge", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-1n1s-4t2x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-1n1s-6t", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-2n2s-4t2x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-2n2s-6t", "cisco$PRODUCT$cloud_services_router_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
