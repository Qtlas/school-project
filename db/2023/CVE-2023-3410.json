This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.", "VENDOR": ["bricksbuilder", "bricksbuilder$PRODUCT$bricks"]}
