This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This was partially patched in version 2.2.7 and fully patched in version 2.2.9.", "PRODUIT": ["ggnome", "ggnome$PRODUCT$garden_gnome_package"]}
