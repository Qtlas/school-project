{"CVE": "CVE-2023-27496", "CWE": ["CWE-20", "NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2023-04-04 20:15:07", "SCORE": 6.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "TITLE": "Envoy may crash when a redirect url without a state param is received in the oauth filter", "DESC": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, the OAuth filter assumes that a `state` query param is present on any response that looks like an OAuth redirect response. Sending it a request with the URI path equivalent to the redirect path, without the `state` parameter, will lead to abnormal termination of Envoy process. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9 contain a patch. The issue can also be mitigated by locking down OAuth traffic, disabling the filter, or by filtering traffic before it reaches the OAuth filter (e.g. via a lua script). \n", "PRODUIT": ["envoyproxy", "envoyproxy$PRODUCT$envoy"]}
