An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of specific wireless packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume resources on an affected device. A sustained attack could lead to the disruption of the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunnel and intermittent loss of wireless client traffic.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_150ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_150ax_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_151axm", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_151axm_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800_embedded_wireless_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800_embedded_wireless_controller_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wireless_lan_controller_software"]}
