The AES-XTS algorithm is usually\nused for disk encryption.\n\nThe AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read\npast the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16\nbyte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext\nbuffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of\nservice.\n\nIf an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer\nbeing decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the\napplication is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue\na Low severity one.", "PRODUIT": "openssl"}
