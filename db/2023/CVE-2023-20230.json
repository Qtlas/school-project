An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete policies created by users associated with a different security domain. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$application_policy_infrastructure_controller"]}
