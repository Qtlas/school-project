And if gserial_suspend gets called afterwards,\nit will lead to accessing of gser->ioport and thus causing\nnull pointer dereference.\n\nAvoid this by adding a null pointer check. Added a static\nspinlock to prevent gser->ioport from becoming null after\nthe newly added null pointer check.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
