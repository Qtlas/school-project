An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application with forged credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to commit toll fraud or to execute commands at the privilege level of the forged account. If that account is an Administrator account, the attacker would have the ability to view confidential information, modify customer settings, or modify settings for other users. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need a valid user ID that is associated with an affected Cisco BroadWorks system.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_application_delivery_platform", "cisco$PRODUCT$broadworks_xtended_services_platform"]}
