This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the woobe_save_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Additionally, input sanitization and escaping is insufficient resulting in the possibility of malicious script injection.", "VENDOR": ["pluginus", "pluginus$PRODUCT$bear_-_woocommerce_bulk_editor_and_products_manager_professional"]}
