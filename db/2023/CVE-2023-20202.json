An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of network requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wncd process to consume available memory and eventually cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105w", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124d", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9136", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9162", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9164", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9166", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9166d1", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_iw6300", "cisco$PRODUCT$esw6300", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe", "cisco$PRODUCT$iw9167eh-x-ap", "cisco$PRODUCT$iw9167eh-x-urwb", "cisco$PRODUCT$iw9167eh-x-wgb", "cisco$PRODUCT$iw9167ih-x-ap"]}
