This description taken from a user-controllable jslob did not get escaped before being added to DOM. Malicious script code can be executed within the victims context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface and API. To exploit this an attacker would require temporary access to the users account or lure a user to a compromised account. We now sanitize jslob content. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "PRODUIT": ["open-xchange", "open-xchange$PRODUCT$open-xchange_appsuite_frontend"]}
