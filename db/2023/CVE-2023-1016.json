This allows authenticated attackers, with administrator permissions, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Note that this attack may only be practical on configurations where it is possible to bypass addslashes due to the database using a nonstandard character set such as GBK.", "PRODUIT": ["hijiriworld", "hijiriworld$PRODUCT$intuitive_custom_post_order"]}
