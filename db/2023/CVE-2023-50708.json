In yii2-authclient prior to version 2.2.15, the Oauth1/2 `state` and OpenID Connect `nonce` is vulnerable for a `timing attack` since it is compared via regular string comparison (instead of `Yii::$app->getSecurity()->compareString()`). Version 2.2.15 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "VENDOR": ["yiiframework", "yiiframework$PRODUCT$yii2-authclient"]}
