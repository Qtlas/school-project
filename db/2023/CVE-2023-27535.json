Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$libcurl", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$ontap_9", "splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$universal_forwarder"]}
