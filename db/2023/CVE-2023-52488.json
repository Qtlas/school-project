In this mode, the\nIC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.\n\nThe regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can\nperform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write\nfrom/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on\nthe SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled\nmanually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these\nfunctions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the\ncache accordingly.\n\nConvert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to\nremove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the\n_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so\ncache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
