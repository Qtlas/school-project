The overflow happens due to an addition operation involving a user-controlled value parsed from the PE binary being used by Shim. This value is further used for memory allocation operations, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw causes memory corruption and can lead to a crash or data integrity issues during the boot phase.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$shim"]}
