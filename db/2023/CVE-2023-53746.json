The\nproblem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the\nkfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the\nvfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.\n\nSince the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev\nobject, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.", "PRODUIT": ""}
