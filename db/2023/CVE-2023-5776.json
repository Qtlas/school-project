This is due to missing nonce validation on the pmdm_wp_ajax_delete_meta, pmdm_wp_delete_user_meta, and pmdm_wp_delete_user_meta functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary user, term, and post meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": ["wpexpertplugins", "wpexpertplugins$PRODUCT$post_meta_data_manager"]}
