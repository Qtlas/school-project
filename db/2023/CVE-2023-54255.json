The existing implementation fails to\ncorrectly accommodate for all those variations, resulting in wrong\nchannel offset calculations and leading to kernel panics.\n\nRewrite dma_base_addr() in order to properly calculate channel offsets\nin a DMAC module. Fix dmaor_read_reg() and dmaor_write_reg(), so that\nthe correct DMAC module base is selected for the DMAOR register.", "PRODUIT": ""}
