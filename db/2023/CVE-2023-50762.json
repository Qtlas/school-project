This is because the text was interpreted as a MIME message and the first paragraph was always treated as an email header section. A digitally signed text from a different context, such as a signed GIT commit, could be used to spoof an email message. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 115.6.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "mozilla", "mozilla$PRODUCT$thunderbird"]}
