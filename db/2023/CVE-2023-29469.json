When hashing empty dict strings in a crafted XML document, xmlDictComputeFastKey in dict.c can produce non-deterministic values, leading to various logic and memory errors, such as a double free. This behavior occurs because there is an attempt to use the first byte of an empty string, and any value is possible (not solely the '\\0' value).", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "xmlsoft", "xmlsoft$PRODUCT$libxml2"]}
