SCP and SFTP plugins don't honor group-based JIT MFA. Establishing a SCP/SFTP connection through The Bastion via a group access where MFA is enforced does not ask for additional factor. This abnormal behavior only applies to per-group-based JIT MFA. Other MFA setup types, such as Immediate MFA, JIT MFA on a per-plugin basis and JIT MFA on a per-account basis are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 3.14.15.", "VENDOR": ["ovh", "ovh$PRODUCT$the-bastion"]}
