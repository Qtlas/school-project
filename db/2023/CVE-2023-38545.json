Due to this bug,\nthe local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the\nwrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,\ncopy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the\nresolved address there.\n\nThe target buffer being a heap based buffer, and the host name coming from the\nURL that curl has been told to operate with.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$libcurl", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10_1809", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10_21h2", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10_22h2", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_11_21h2", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_11_22h2", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_11_23h2", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2019", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_server_2022", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_insight", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_workflow_automation"]}
