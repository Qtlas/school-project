{"CVE": "CVE-2016-10137", "CWE": ["CWE-310"], "DATE": "2017-01-13T09:59:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third-party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so.", "VENDOR": ["adups", "adups$PRODUCT$adups_fota"]}
