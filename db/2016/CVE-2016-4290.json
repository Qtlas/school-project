When calculating this length, the application will use a value from the file and add a constant to it without checking whether the addition of the constant will cause the integer to overflow which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into it. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.", "VENDOR": ["hancom", "hancom$PRODUCT$hancom_office_2014"]}
