This behavior occurs in the remote network alert system (deprecated since Q1 2016). This affects other uses of the codebase, such as Bitcoin Knots before v0.13.0.knots20160814 and many altcoins.", "VENDOR": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin$PRODUCT$bitcoin-qt", "bitcoin$PRODUCT$bitcoin_core", "bitcoin$PRODUCT$bitcoind"]}
