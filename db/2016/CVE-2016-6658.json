Although it is not recommended, a user can specify a credential in the URL (basic auth or OAuth) to access the buildpack through the CLI. For example, the user could include a GitHub username and password in the URL to access a private repo. Because the URL to access the buildpack is stored unencrypted, an operator with privileged access to the Cloud Controller database could view these credentials.", "VENDOR": ["cloudfoundry", "cloudfoundry$PRODUCT$cf-release", "pivotal_software", "pivotal_software$PRODUCT$cloud_foundry_elastic_runtime"]}
