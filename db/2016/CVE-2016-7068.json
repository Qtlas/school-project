This issue is based on the fact that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage of that behaviour.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "powerdns", "powerdns$PRODUCT$authoritative", "powerdns$PRODUCT$recursor"]}
