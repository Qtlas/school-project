Script code within hyperlinks at HTML E-Mails is not getting correctly sanitized when using base64 encoded \"data\" resources. This allows an attacker to provide hyperlinks that may execute script code instead of directing to a proper location. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).", "VENDOR": ["open-xchange", "open-xchange$PRODUCT$open-xchange_appsuite"]}
