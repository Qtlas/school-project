The implementation permits a remote attacker to exhaust computational resources on the remote endpoint by repeatedly sending ISAKMP fragment packets in a particular order such that the worst-case computational complexity is realized in the algorithm utilized to determine if reassembly of the fragments can take place.", "VENDOR": ["ipsec-tools", "ipsec-tools$PRODUCT$ipsec-tools"]}
