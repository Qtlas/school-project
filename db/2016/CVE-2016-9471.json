{"CVE": "CVE-2016-9471", "CWE": ["CWE-75", "NVD-CWE-Other"], "DATE": "2017-03-28T02:59:01", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Special Element Injection. Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver.", "VENDOR": ["revive-adserver", "revive-adserver$PRODUCT$revive_adserver"]}
