Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle attacker can send an invalid size for a file transfer which will trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could result in a denial of service or copy data from memory to the file, resulting in an information leak if the file is sent to another user.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "pidgin", "pidgin$PRODUCT$pidgin"]}
