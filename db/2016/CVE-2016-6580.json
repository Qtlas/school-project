{"CVE": "CVE-2016-6580", "CWE": ["CWE-399"], "DATE": "2017-01-10T15:59:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority library prior to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer assign priority information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.", "VENDOR": ["python", "python$PRODUCT$python_priority_library"]}
