An attacker can exploit this flaw through a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypass combined with JavaScript-triggered file uploads to the web server, ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. \n\nThis vulnerability bypasses the server-side mitigations introduced in ZDI-15-156 and ZDI-16-481 by shifting the exploitation to the client-side. \n\nThis product is now referred to as\u00a0Hanwha Wisenet SSM and it is unknown if current versions are affected.", "VENDOR": []}
