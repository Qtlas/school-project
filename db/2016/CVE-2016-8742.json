{"CVE": "CVE-2016-8742", "CWE": ["CWE-264"], "DATE": "2018-02-12T17:29:00.277000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "The Windows installer that the Apache CouchDB team provides was vulnerable to local privilege escalation. All files in the install inherit the file permissions of the parent directory and therefore a non-privileged user can substitute any executable for the nssm.exe service launcher, or CouchDB batch or binary files. A subsequent service or server restart will then run that binary with administrator privilege. This issue affected CouchDB 2.0.0 (Windows platform only) and was addressed in CouchDB 2.0.0.1.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$couchdb", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows"]}
