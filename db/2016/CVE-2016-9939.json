The library will allocate a memory block based on the length field of the ASN.1 object. If there is not enough content octets in the ASN.1 object, then the function will fail and the memory block will be zeroed even if its unused. There is a noticeable delay during the wipe for a large allocation.", "VENDOR": ["cryptopp", "cryptopp$PRODUCT$crypto\\+\\+", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
