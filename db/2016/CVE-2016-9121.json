When deriving a shared key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted message, go-jose neglected to check that the received public key on a message is on the same curve as the static private key of the receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an invalid curve attack.", "VENDOR": ["go-jose_project", "go-jose_project$PRODUCT$go-jose"]}
