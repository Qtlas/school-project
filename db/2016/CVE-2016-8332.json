{"CVE": "CVE-2016-8332", "CWE": ["CWE-119"], "DATE": "2016-10-28T14:59:00.167000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "A buffer overflow in OpenJPEG 2.1.1 causes arbitrary code execution when parsing a crafted image. An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the jpeg2000 image file format parser as implemented in the OpenJpeg library. A specially crafted jpeg2000 file can cause an out of bound heap write resulting in heap corruption leading to arbitrary code execution. For a successful attack, the target user needs to open a malicious jpeg2000 file. The jpeg2000 image file format is mostly used for embedding images inside PDF documents and the OpenJpeg library is used by a number of popular PDF renderers making PDF documents a likely attack vector.", "VENDOR": ["uclouvain", "uclouvain$PRODUCT$openjpeg"]}
