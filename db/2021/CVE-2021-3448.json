When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_network_function_cloud_native_environment", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "thekelleys", "thekelleys$PRODUCT$dnsmasq"]}
