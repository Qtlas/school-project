Using `File.createTempFile` in JDK will result in creating and using insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks. Auto-generated code (Java, Scala) that deals with uploading or downloading binary data through API endpoints will create insecure temporary files during the process. Affected generators: `java` (jersey2, okhttp-gson (default library)), `scala-finch`. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.", "VENDOR": ["openapi-generator", "openapi-generator$PRODUCT$openapi_generator"]}
