This vulnerability exists because ARP entries are mismanaged. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by continuously sending traffic that results in incomplete ARP entries. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause ARP requests on the device to be unsuccessful for legitimate hosts, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
