This warning is caused by\nwork->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization.\n\nThis may happen, since input_dev->close() calls\ncancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->work initalization happens _after_\ninput_register_device() call.\n\nSo this patch moves dev->work initialization before registering input\ndevice", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
