This could result in one or more leaf switches being removed from the fabric. This vulnerability is due to mishandling of ingress TCP traffic to a specific port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of TCP packets to a specific port on a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) configured on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a specific packet queue to queue network buffers but never process them, leading to an eventual queue wedge. This could cause control plane traffic to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition where the leaf switches are unavailable. Note: This vulnerability requires a manual intervention to power-cycle the device to recover.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93120tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_93128tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9332pq", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372px", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372px-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9372tx-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9396px", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9396tx", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os"]}
