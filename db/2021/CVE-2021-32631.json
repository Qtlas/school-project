Common before commit number 3b96cb0293d3443b870351945f41d7d55cb34b53 did not properly verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens. This allows someone to forge a valid JWT. Being able to forge JWTs may lead to authentication bypasses. Commit number 3b96cb0293d3443b870351945f41d7d55cb34b53 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may use the parseClaimsJws method to correctly verify the signature of a JWT.", "PRODUIT": ["nimble-project", "nimble-project$PRODUCT$common"]}
