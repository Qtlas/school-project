During the add printer process, a local attacker can overwrite CNMurGE.dll and, if timed properly, the overwritten DLL will be loaded into a SYSTEM process resulting in escalation of privileges. This occurs because the driver drops a world-writable DLL into a CanonBJ %PROGRAMDATA% location that gets loaded by printisolationhost (a system process).", "PRODUIT": ["canon", "canon$PRODUCT$pixma_tr150", "canon$PRODUCT$pixma_tr150_firmware"]}
