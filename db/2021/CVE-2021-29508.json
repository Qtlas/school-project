And by doing so allowing the serializer to create any type on the deserializing end. This is the same issue that exists for .NET BinaryFormatter https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2300?view=vs-2019. This also applies to the fork of Wire.", "VENDOR": ["asynkron", "asynkron$PRODUCT$wire"]}
