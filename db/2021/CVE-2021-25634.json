An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to modify a digitally signed ODF document to insert an additional signing time timestamp which LibreOffice would incorrectly present as a valid signature signed at the bogus signing time. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "libreoffice", "libreoffice$PRODUCT$libreoffice"]}
