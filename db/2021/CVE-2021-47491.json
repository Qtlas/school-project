The intended usecase is to avoid TLB\nmisses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file types\nso a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block\ndevice, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  This\nmay cause bugs, like [1] and [2].\n\nThis is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP for\nregular files in order to close the attack surface.\n\n[shy828301@gmail.com: fix vm_file check [3]]", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
