In affected versions and in certain cases, Postscript files could be read and written when specifically excluded by a `module` policy in `policy.xml`. ex. <policy domain=\"module\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"PS\" />. The issue has been resolved in ImageMagick 7.1.0-7 and in 6.9.12-22. Fortunately, in the wild, few users utilize the `module` policy and instead use the `coder` policy that is also our workaround recommendation: <policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"{PS,EPI,EPS,EPSF,EPSI}\" />.", "VENDOR": ["imagemagick", "imagemagick$PRODUCT$imagemagick"]}
