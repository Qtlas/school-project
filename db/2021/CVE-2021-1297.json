These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using the web-based management interface to upload a file to location on an affected device that they should not have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on the file system of the affected device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160w_wireless-ac_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160w_wireless-ac_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260p_vpn_router_with_poe", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260p_vpn_router_with_poe_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260w_wireless-ac_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260w_wireless-ac_vpn_router_firmware"]}
