The handler did not validate the length of the request, which can lead to a state where yubihsm-connector becomes stuck in a loop waiting for the YubiHSM to send it data, preventing any further operations until the yubihsm-connector is restarted. An attacker can send 0, 1, or 2 bytes to trigger this.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "yubico", "yubico$PRODUCT$yubihsm_connector"]}
