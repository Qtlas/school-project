If the $patternselect parameter to validateAddress() is set to 'php' (the default, defined by PHPMailer::$validator), and the global namespace contains a function called php, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same name. Mitigated in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as validator function names.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "phpmailer_project", "phpmailer_project$PRODUCT$phpmailer"]}
