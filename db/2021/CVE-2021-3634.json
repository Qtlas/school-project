The SSH protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key re-exchange.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "libssh", "libssh$PRODUCT$libssh", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$cloud_backup", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_workbench", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$virtualization"]}
