The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter before using it to construct LDAP queries. An attacker could bypass authentication exploiting this vulnerability by sending login attempts in which there is a valid password but a wildcard character in email parameter.", "VENDOR": ["huntflow", "huntflow$PRODUCT$huntflow_enterprise"]}
