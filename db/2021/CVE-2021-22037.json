{"CVE": "CVE-2021-22037", "CWE": ["CWE-427"], "DATE": "2021-10-29 12:15:07", "SCORE": 7.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "Under certain circumstances, when manipulating the Windows registry, InstallBuilder uses the reg.exe system command. The full path to the command is not enforced, which results in a search in the search path until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes precedence over the system command. The vulnerability only affects Windows installers.", "PRODUIT": "vmware"}
