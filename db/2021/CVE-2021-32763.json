{"CVE": "CVE-2021-32763", "CWE": ["CWE-400", "NVD-CWE-Other"], "DATE": "2021-07-20T17:15:07", "CVSS": 4.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "TITLE": "Regular Expression Denial of Service in OpenProject forum messages", "DESC": "OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.", "VENDOR": ["openproject", "openproject$PRODUCT$openproject"]}
