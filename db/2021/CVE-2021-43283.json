A command injection vulnerability was found within the web interface of the device, allowing an attacker with valid credentials to inject arbitrary shell commands to be executed by the device with root privileges. This occurs in the ping and traceroute features. An attacker would thus be able to use this vulnerability to open a reverse shell on the device with root privileges.", "VENDOR": ["govicture", "govicture$PRODUCT$wr1200", "govicture$PRODUCT$wr1200_firmware"]}
