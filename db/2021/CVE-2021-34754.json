These vulnerabilities are due to incomplete processing during deep packet inspection for ENIP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted ENIP packet to the targeted interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured access control and intrusion policies that should be activated for the ENIP packet.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_management_center"]}
