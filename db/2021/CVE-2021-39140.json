In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$snapmanager", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$business_activity_monitoring", "oracle$PRODUCT$commerce_guided_search", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_billing_and_revenue_management_elastic_charging_engine", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_automated_test_suite", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_binding_support_function", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_policy", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_unified_inventory_management", "oracle$PRODUCT$retail_xstore_point_of_service", "oracle$PRODUCT$utilities_framework", "oracle$PRODUCT$utilities_testing_accelerator", "oracle$PRODUCT$webcenter_portal", "xstream", "xstream$PRODUCT$xstream"]}
