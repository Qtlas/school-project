When the software is installed with a non-default installation directory off of the system root, the installer fails to properly set ACLs. This allows lower privileged users to replace the VPN executable with a malicious one. When a higher privileged user such as an Administrator launches that executable, it is possible for the lower privileged user to escalate to Administrator privileges.", "VENDOR": ["leap", "leap$PRODUCT$bitmask_riseup_vpn", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows"]}
