Sourcegraph before version 3.30.0 has two potential information leaks. The site-admin area can be accessed by regular users and all information and features are properly protected except for daily usage statistics and code intelligence uploads and indexes. It is not possible to alter the information, nor interact with any other features in the site-admin area. The issue is patched in version 3.30.0, where the information cannot be accessed by unprivileged users. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "VENDOR": ["sourcegraph", "sourcegraph$PRODUCT$sourcegraph"]}
