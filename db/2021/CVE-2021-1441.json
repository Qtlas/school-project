This vulnerability is due to incorrect validations of parameters passed to a diagnostic script that is executed when the device boots up. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tampering with an executable file stored on a device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unsigned code at boot time and bypass the software image verification check part of the secure boot process of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need administrative level credentials (level 15) on the device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$esr6300", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe", "cisco$PRODUCT$ir1101"]}
