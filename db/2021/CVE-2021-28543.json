This does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product; however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "varnish-cache", "varnish-cache$PRODUCT$varnish-modules", "varnish-cache$PRODUCT$varnish-modules_klarlack"]}
