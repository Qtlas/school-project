In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. In particular JupyterLab doesn\u2019t sanitize the action attribute of html `<form>`. Using this it is possible to trigger the form validation outside of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.", "PRODUIT": ["jupyter", "jupyter$PRODUCT$jupyterlab"]}
