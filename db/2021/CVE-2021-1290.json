These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP requests are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160w_wireless-ac_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv160w_wireless-ac_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260p_vpn_router_with_poe", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260p_vpn_router_with_poe_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260w_wireless-ac_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv260w_wireless-ac_vpn_router_firmware"]}
