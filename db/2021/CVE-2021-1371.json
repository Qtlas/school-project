This vulnerability occurs because the default configuration is applied for console authentication and authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the console port and authenticating as a read-only user. A successful exploit could allow a user with read-only permissions to access administrative privileges.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1120_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1160_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4321_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4351_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4451_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4461_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1000", "cisco$PRODUCT$cloud_services_router_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe_sd-wan"]}
