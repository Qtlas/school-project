During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove\nfunction tries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using\ncancel_delayed_work_sync routine and unregister switch from dsa.\n\nDuring dsa_unregister_switch it calls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn\nreschedules the workqueue since mib_interval is non-zero.\nDue to which queue executed after mib_interval and it tries to access\ndp->slave. But the slave is unregistered in the ksz_switch_remove\nfunction. Hence kernel crashes.\n\nTo avoid this crash, before canceling the workqueue, resetted the\nmib_interval to 0.\n\nv1 -> v2:\n-Removed the if condition in ksz_mib_read_work", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
