As a result, remote unauthenticated clients can send messages to TCP port 1801 that the Collector Service will process. Additionally, upon processing of such messages, the service deserializes them in insecure manner, allowing remote arbitrary code execution as LocalSystem.", "VENDOR": ["solarwinds", "solarwinds$PRODUCT$orion_platform"]}
