This vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation when an affected device establishes TLS connections. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to spoof a trusted host and then extract sensitive information or alter certain API requests.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asyncos", "cisco$PRODUCT$email_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$web_security_appliance"]}
