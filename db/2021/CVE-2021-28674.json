This occurs because node IDs are predictable (with incrementing numbers) and the access control on Services/NodeManagement.asmx/DeleteObjNow is incorrect. To exploit this, an attacker must be authenticated and must have node management rights associated with at least one valid group on the platform.", "VENDOR": ["solarwinds", "solarwinds$PRODUCT$orion_platform"]}
