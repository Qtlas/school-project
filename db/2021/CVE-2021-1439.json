This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming mDNS traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted mDNS packet to an affected device through a wireless network that is configured in FlexConnect local switching mode or through a wired network on a configured mDNS VLAN. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the access point (AP) to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1540", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1560", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_1800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_2800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_3800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_4800", "cisco$PRODUCT$aironet_access_point_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9100", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_iw6300", "cisco$PRODUCT$esw6300"]}
