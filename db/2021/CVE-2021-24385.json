This is a major vulnerability as the user input is not escaped and passed directly to the get_col function and it allows SQL injection. The Rest API endpoint which invokes this function also does not have any required permissions/authentication and can be accessed by an anonymous user.", "VENDOR": ["ninjateam", "ninjateam$PRODUCT$filebird"]}
