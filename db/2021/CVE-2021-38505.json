Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.", "VENDOR": ["microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "mozilla", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox_esr", "mozilla$PRODUCT$thunderbird"]}
