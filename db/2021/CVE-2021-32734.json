In versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.011, and 21.0.3, the Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud Server returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. The issue was fixed in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. As a workaround, one may disable the Nextcloud Text application in Nextcloud Server app settings.", "PRODUIT": "nextcloud"}
