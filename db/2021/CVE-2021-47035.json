The Write-Only permission\nis not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should\nalways set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions\nthat allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to\nhave consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things\nto work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.\nHence remove this configuration.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
