It is also usable outside of Rails in any Rack app as Rack middleware. better_errors prior to 2.8.0 did not implement CSRF protection for its internal requests. It also did not enforce the correct \"Content-Type\" header for these requests, which allowed a cross-origin \"simple request\" to be made without CORS protection. These together left an application with better_errors enabled open to cross-origin attacks. As a developer tool, better_errors documentation strongly recommends addition only to the `development` bundle group, so this vulnerability should only affect development environments. Please ensure that your project limits better_errors to the `development` group (or the non-Rails equivalent). Starting with release 2.8.x, CSRF protection is enforced. It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest release, or minimally to \"~> 2.8.3\". There are no known workarounds to mitigate the risk of using older releases of better_errors.", "PRODUIT": ["better_errors_project", "better_errors_project$PRODUCT$better_errors"]}
