This vulnerability is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted UPnP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$application_extension_platform", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w_wireless-n_vpn_firewall", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w_wireless-n_vpn_firewall_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w_wireless-n_multifunction_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w_wireless-n_multifunction_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w_wireless-n_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w_wireless-n_vpn_router_firmware"]}
