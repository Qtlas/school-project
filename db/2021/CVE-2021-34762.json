The attacker would require valid device credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTPS request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the device.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_management_center_virtual_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense", "cisco$PRODUCT$sourcefire_defense_center"]}
