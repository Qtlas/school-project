This causes a null dereference error as the workqueue is only\nallocated and initialized in mcp251x_open().\n\nTo fix this we move the workqueue init to mcp251x_can_probe() as there\nis no reason to do it later and repeat it whenever mcp251x_open() is\ncalled.\n\n[mkl: fix error handling in mcp251x_stop()]", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
