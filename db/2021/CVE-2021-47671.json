This means that the\nskb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other\nterms, this is a memory leak.\n\nThis patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and\nlet the function continue.\n\nIssue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for\ndetails.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
