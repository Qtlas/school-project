Security-relevant validation of filename extensions is plausibly affected. Methods of NSString for conversion to a string may return a partial result. Because they call CStr::from_ptr on a pointer to the string buffer, the string is terminated at the first '\\0' byte, which might not be the end of the string.", "PRODUIT": ["fruity_project", "fruity_project$PRODUCT$fruity"]}
