This function is typically used from react-scripts (in Create React App projects), where the usage is safe. Only when this function is manually invoked with user-provided values (ie: by custom code) is there the potential for command injection. If you're consuming it from react-scripts then this issue does not affect you.", "PRODUIT": ["facebook", "facebook$PRODUCT$react-dev-utils"]}
