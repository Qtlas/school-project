An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a non-privileged credential for Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator (MSO) to send a specific API request to a managed Cisco APIC or Cloud APIC device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain Administrator credentials on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$application_policy_infrastructure_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$cloud_application_policy_infrastructure_controller"]}
