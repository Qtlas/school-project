The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.", "PRODUIT": ["dmg2img_project", "dmg2img_project$PRODUCT$dmg2img"]}
