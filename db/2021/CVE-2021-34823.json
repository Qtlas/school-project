This allows unauthenticated remote users to retrieve files accessible to the logged-on macOS user. When a remote user sends a crafted HTTP request to the server, it triggers a code path that will download a configuration file from a specified remote machine over HTTP. There is an XXE flaw in processing of this configuration file that allows reading local (to macOS) files and uploading them to remote machines.", "PRODUIT": ["on24", "on24$PRODUCT$screenshare"]}
