However, it also destructs the monitoring targets in\n'dbgfs_before_terminate()' without holding the lock.  This can result in\na use_after_free bug.  This commit avoids the race by protecting the\ndestruction with the corresponding 'kdamond_lock'.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
