This error message can be reached\nseveral millions of times per second, causing spam to the kernel's printk\nbuffer and bringing the CPU usage up to 100% (so, it should be rate\nlimited). However, since there is at least one driver that is in the\nmainline and suffers from the error condition, it is more useful to\nerr_printk() here instead of just rate limiting the error message (in hopes\nthat it will make it easier for other drivers that suffer from this issue\nto be spotted).", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
