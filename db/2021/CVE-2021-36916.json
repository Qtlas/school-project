The function \"hmwp_get_user_ip\" tries to retrieve the IP address from multiple headers, including IP address headers that the user can spoof, such as \"X-Forwarded-For.\" As a result, the malicious payload supplied in one of these IP address headers will be directly inserted into the SQL query, making SQL injection possible.", "VENDOR": ["wpwave", "wpwave$PRODUCT$hide_my_wp"]}
