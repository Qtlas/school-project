However, the field name is not sanitised or escaped before being output back in the page, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting issue. There is also no CSRF check done before saving the setting, allowing attackers to make a logged in admin set arbitrary Custom Fields, including one with XSS payload in it.", "PRODUIT": ["e4j", "e4j$PRODUCT$vikrentcar_car_rental_management_system"]}
