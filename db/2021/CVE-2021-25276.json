An unprivileged Windows user (having access to the server's filesystem) can add an FTP user by copying a valid profile file to this directory. For example, if this profile sets up a user with a C:\\ home directory, then the attacker obtains access to read or replace arbitrary files with LocalSystem privileges.", "PRODUIT": "solarwinds"}
