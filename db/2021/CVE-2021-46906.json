When running the\nsyzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to\ncalculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to\nthe usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes.\n\nTo fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero\nreport size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it\nfrom hid_submit_ctrl().", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
