These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40_wireless_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80_wireless_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-c", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-f", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800_embedded_wireless_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
