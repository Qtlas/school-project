{"CVE": "CVE-2021-39201", "CWE": ["CWE-79"], "DATE": "2021-09-09 22:15:09", "SCORE": 7.6, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Authenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) in WordPress editor", "DESC": "WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an authenticated but low-privileged user (like contributor/author) to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/ https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress)", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "wordpress", "wordpress$PRODUCT$wordpress"]}
