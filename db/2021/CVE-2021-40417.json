Due to an integer overflow with regards to this calculation, this can result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap buffer is written to, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur. This can result in code execution under the context of the application.", "VENDOR": ["blackmagicdesign", "blackmagicdesign$PRODUCT$davinci_resolve"]}
