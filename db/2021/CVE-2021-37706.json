In affected versions if the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim\u2019s network may forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim\u2019s machine. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.", "PRODUIT": ["asterisk", "asterisk$PRODUCT$certified_asterisk", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "sangoma", "sangoma$PRODUCT$asterisk", "teluu", "teluu$PRODUCT$pjsip"]}
