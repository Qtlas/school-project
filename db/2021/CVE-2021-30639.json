An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling during non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated with the Request object was not reset between requests. This meant that once a non-blocking I/O error occurred, all future requests handled by that request object would fail. Users were able to trigger non-blocking I/O errors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby creating the possibility of triggering a DoS. Applications that do not use non-blocking I/O are not exposed to this vulnerability. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.3 to 10.0.4; 9.0.44; 8.5.64.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$tomcat", "mcafee", "mcafee$PRODUCT$epolicy_orchestrator", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$big_data_spatial_and_graph"]}
