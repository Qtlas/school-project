This vulnerability is due to oversubscription of resources that occurs when applying ACLs to port channel interfaces. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access network resources that are protected by the ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access network resources that would be protected by the ACL that was applied on the port channel interface.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9500_16-slot", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9500_4-slot", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9500_8-slot", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9504", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9508", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_9516", "cisco$PRODUCT$nx-os"]}
