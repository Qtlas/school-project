Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_insight", "netty", "netty$PRODUCT$netty", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$banking_apis", "oracle$PRODUCT$banking_digital_experience", "oracle$PRODUCT$commerce_guided_search", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_brm_-_elastic_charging_engine", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_binding_support_function", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_diameter_signaling_router", "oracle$PRODUCT$peoplesoft_enterprise_peopletools", "oracle$PRODUCT$webcenter_portal", "quarkus", "quarkus$PRODUCT$quarkus"]}
