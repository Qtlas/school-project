Such sensitive information as hashed credentials, hardcoded plaintext passwords for other services, configuration files, and private keys can be disclosed in this fashion. Improper handling of filenames that identify virtual resources, such as \"/dev/urandom\" allows an attacker to effect a denial of service attack against the command line interfaces of the Quagga services (zebra and ripd).", "PRODUIT": ["dlink", "dlink$PRODUCT$dir-2640-us", "dlink$PRODUCT$dir-2640-us_firmware"]}
