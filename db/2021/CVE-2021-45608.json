Remote code execution from the WAN interface (TCP port 20005) cannot be ruled out; however, exploitability was judged to be of \"rather significant complexity\" but not \"impossible.\" The overflow is in SoftwareBus_dispatchNormalEPMsgOut in the KCodes NetUSB kernel module. Affected NETGEAR devices are D7800 before 1.0.1.68, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.122, and R6700v3 before 1.0.4.122.", "VENDOR": ["netgear", "netgear$PRODUCT$d7800", "netgear$PRODUCT$d7800_firmware", "netgear$PRODUCT$r6400v2", "netgear$PRODUCT$r6400v2_firmware", "netgear$PRODUCT$r6700v3", "netgear$PRODUCT$r6700v3_firmware"]}
