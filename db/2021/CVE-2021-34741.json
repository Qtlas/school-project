This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming emails. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email through Cisco ESA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust all the available CPU resources on an affected device for an extended period of time, preventing other emails from being processed and resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asyncos", "cisco$PRODUCT$m170", "cisco$PRODUCT$m190", "cisco$PRODUCT$m380", "cisco$PRODUCT$m390", "cisco$PRODUCT$m390x", "cisco$PRODUCT$m680", "cisco$PRODUCT$m690", "cisco$PRODUCT$m690x", "cisco$PRODUCT$s195", "cisco$PRODUCT$s395", "cisco$PRODUCT$s695"]}
