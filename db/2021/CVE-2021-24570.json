The process to create a new button is lacking a CSRF check. An attacker could use this to make an authenticated admin create a new button. Furthermore, one of the Button field is not escaped before being output in an attribute when editing a Button, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue as well.", "PRODUIT": "wpplugin"}
