Versions prior to 0.11.0 allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on any macOS machine with ActivityWatch running. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by having the user visiting a website with the page title set to a malicious string. An attacker could use another application to accomplish the same, but the web browser is the most likely attack vector. This issue is patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users can run the latest version of aw-watcher-window from source, or manually patch the `printAppTitle.scpt` file.", "VENDOR": ["activitywatch", "activitywatch$PRODUCT$activitywatch", "apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos"]}
