This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the mu_add_roles_in_signup_meta() and mu_add_roles_in_signup_meta_recently() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add additional roles to users via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "PRODUIT": ["multiple_roles_project", "multiple_roles_project$PRODUCT$multiple_roles"]}
