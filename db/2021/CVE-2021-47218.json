This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since\nthe policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed\nhashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called\non it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.\n\nFix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid\nempty hashtab when the allocation fails.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
