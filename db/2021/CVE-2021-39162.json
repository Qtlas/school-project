Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and SETTINGS frame are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a DoS in the presence of untrusted *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. If only trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk of this condition being triggered.", "VENDOR": ["envoyproxy", "envoyproxy$PRODUCT$envoy", "pomerium", "pomerium$PRODUCT$pomerium"]}
