This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$evolved_programmable_network_manager", "cisco$PRODUCT$prime_infrastructure"]}
