These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24p-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24p-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24s-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24s-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24t-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24t-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24u-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24u-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24ux-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24ux-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48p-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48p-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48s-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48s-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48t-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48t-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48u-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48u-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48un-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48un-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48uxm-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48uxm-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l_stack", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9400", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9400_supervisor_engine-1", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9407r", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9410r", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9500", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-c", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-f", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$embedded_wireless_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
