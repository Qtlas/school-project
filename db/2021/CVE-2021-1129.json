The vulnerability exists because a secure authentication token is not required when authenticating to the general purpose API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request for information to the general purpose API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain system and configuration information from the affected device, resulting in an unauthorized information disclosure.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$content_security_management_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$email_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$web_security_appliance"]}
