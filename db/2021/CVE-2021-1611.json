This vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed EoGRE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-c", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-f", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
