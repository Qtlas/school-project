Since .htaccess only restricts the PHP type, uploading HTML-type files leads to stored XSS vulnerabilities. If the .htaccess configuration is improper, for example before the XE 1.11.2 version, you can upload the PHP type file to GETSHELL.", "VENDOR": ["xpressengine", "xpressengine$PRODUCT$xpressengine"]}
