This \"patching\" command defaults to calling a trusted binary, but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a \"c2-update\" command. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as the application binary. This was addressed in version 0.10.0", "PRODUIT": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$nifi_minifi_c\\+\\+"]}
