Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.Affected versions of Node.js that do not accept multi-value Relative Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's ambiguous presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "nodejs", "nodejs$PRODUCT$node.js", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$graalvm", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_cluster", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_connectors", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_enterprise_monitor", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_server", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_workbench", "oracle$PRODUCT$peoplesoft_enterprise_peopletools"]}
