Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
