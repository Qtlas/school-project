These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016_multi-wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv016_multi-wan_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042_dual_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042_dual_wan_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv042g_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082_dual_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv082_dual_wan_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv320_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv325_dual_gigabit_wan_vpn_router_firmware"]}
