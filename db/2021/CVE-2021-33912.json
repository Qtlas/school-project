The vulnerable code may be part of the supply chain of a site's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., with additional configuration, Exim can use libspf2; the Postfix web site links to unofficial patches for use of libspf2 with Postfix; older versions of spfquery relied on libspf2) but most often is not.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "libspf2_project", "libspf2_project$PRODUCT$libspf2"]}
