Subsequent log messages will be appended to the file, prefixed by a timestamp and some logging metadata. Remote code execution can be achieved by using this vulnerability to append to a shell script on the router's filesystem, and then awaiting or triggering the execution of that script. A remote, unauthenticated root shell can easily be obtained on the device in this fashion.", "VENDOR": ["dlink", "dlink$PRODUCT$dir-2640-us", "dlink$PRODUCT$dir-2640-us_firmware"]}
