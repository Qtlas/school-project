When using the origin path as __proto__, the attribute of the object is accessed instead of a path. **Note:** This vulnerability derives from an incomplete fix in https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CACHEDPATHRELATIVE-72573", "VENDOR": ["cached-path-relative_project", "cached-path-relative_project$PRODUCT$cached-path-relative", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
