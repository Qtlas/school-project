CODESYS Git does not implement certificate validation by default, so it does not verify that the server provides a valid and trusted HTTPS certificate. Since the certificate of the server to which the connection is made is not properly verified, the server connection is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.", "PRODUIT": ["codesys", "codesys$PRODUCT$development_system", "codesys$PRODUCT$git"]}
