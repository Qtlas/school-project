An attacker could pass in memory objects larger than the buffer and wrap around to have a smaller buffer than required, allowing the attacker access to the other parts of the heap. We recommend upgrading the Google Cloud IoT Device SDK for Embedded C used to 1.0.3 or greater.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$cloud_iot_device_sdk_for_embedded_c"]}
