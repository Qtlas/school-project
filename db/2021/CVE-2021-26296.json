Due to that limitation, it is possible (although difficult) for an attacker to calculate a future CSRF token value and to use that value to trick a user into executing unwanted actions on an application.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$myfaces", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_insight"]}
