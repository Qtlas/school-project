This could be used to create a heap overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel. It was addressed via commit d1f82808877b (\"io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers\") (v5.13-rc1) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced in ddf0322db79c (\"io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS\") (v5.7-rc1).", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
