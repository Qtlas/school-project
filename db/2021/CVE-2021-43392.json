This is associated with the ECDSA signature algorithm on the Java Card J-SAFE3 and STSAFE-J platforms exposing a 3.0.4 Java Card API. It is exploitable for STSAFE-J in closed configuration and J-SIGN (when signature verification is activated) but not for J-SAFE3 EPASS BAC and EAC products. It might also impact other products based on the J-SAFE-3 Java Card platform.", "VENDOR": ["st", "st$PRODUCT$j-safe3", "st$PRODUCT$j-safe3_firmware", "st$PRODUCT$stsafe-j", "st$PRODUCT$stsafe-j_firmware"]}
