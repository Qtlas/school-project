The vulnerability is due to a logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets over an established IPsec connection. A successful exploit could cause the device to crash, forcing it to reload. Important: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would not cause a compromise of any encrypted data. Note: This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.1 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.0.0.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_virtual_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2100", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2110", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2130", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense", "cisco$PRODUCT$ftd_virtual"]}
