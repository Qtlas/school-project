This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.", "PRODUIT": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu"]}
