In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$cordova", "systeminformation", "systeminformation$PRODUCT$systeminformation"]}
