This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$7600_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-12c-f-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-12c-ft-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-4c-f-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-4c-ft-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-6cz-f-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-6cz-f-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-6cz-fs-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-6cz-fs-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-6cz-ft-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_901-6cz-ft-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$cbr-8", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
