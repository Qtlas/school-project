The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize target names when caching a repository, or when saving specific targets to an output directory. When targets are cached or saved, files could be overwritten with arbitrary content anywhere on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.", "PRODUIT": ["amazon", "amazon$PRODUCT$tough"]}
