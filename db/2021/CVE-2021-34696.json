This vulnerability is due to incorrect programming of hardware when an ACL is configured using a method other than the configuration CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_902", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_903", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_907", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-10sz-pd", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-10sz-pd_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-12cz-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-12cz-a_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-12cz-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-12cz-d_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-12sz-im", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-12sz-im_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-24sz-im", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-24sz-im_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-24sz-m", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-24sz-m_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-24tz-m", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-24tz-m_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-4sz-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-4sz-a_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-4sz-d", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920-4sz-d_r", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_920u-12sz-im", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
