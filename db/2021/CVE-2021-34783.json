This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of SSL/TLS messages when the device performs software-based SSL/TLS decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Datagram TLS (DTLS) messages cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
