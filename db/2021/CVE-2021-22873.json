Such open redirects had previously been available by design to allow third party ad servers to track such metrics when delivering ads. However, third party click tracking via redirects is not a viable option anymore, leading to such open redirect functionality being removed and reclassified as a vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": "revive-adserver"}
