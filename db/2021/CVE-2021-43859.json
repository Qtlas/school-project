Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. XStream 1.4.19 monitors and accumulates the time it takes to add elements to collections and throws an exception if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE mode to prevent recursion. See GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a workaround if an upgrade is not possible.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "jenkins", "jenkins$PRODUCT$jenkins", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$commerce_guided_search", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_brm_-_elastic_charging_engine", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_cloud_native_core_automated_test_suite", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_diameter_intelligence_hub", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_policy_management", "oracle$PRODUCT$flexcube_private_banking", "oracle$PRODUCT$retail_xstore_point_of_service", "xstream", "xstream$PRODUCT$xstream"]}
