For example, if a user's password is changed by an administrator due to an otherwise unrelated credential leak, that user account's current session is still valid after the password change, potentially allowing the attacker who originally compromised the credential to remain logged in and able to cause further damage.  This vulnerability is mitigated by the use of the Platform Login feature. This issue is related to\u00a0CVE-2019-5638.", "VENDOR": ["rapid7", "rapid7$PRODUCT$insightvm"]}
