ASP.NET allows remote debugging of web applications, if configured to do so. Debug mode causes ASP.NET to compile applications with extra information. The information enables a debugger to closely monitor and control the execution of an application. If an attacker could successfully start a remote debugging session, this is likely to disclose sensitive information about the web application and supporting infrastructure that may be valuable in targeting SWI with malicious intent.", "PRODUIT": ["solarwinds", "solarwinds$PRODUCT$kiwi_syslog_server"]}
