When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly \"short-cut\" the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.", "VENDOR": ["broadcom", "broadcom$PRODUCT$fabric_operating_system", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$libcurl", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci_management_node", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci_storage_node", "netapp$PRODUCT$solidfire", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$communications_billing_and_revenue_management", "oracle$PRODUCT$essbase", "siemens", "siemens$PRODUCT$sinec_infrastructure_network_services", "splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$universal_forwarder"]}
