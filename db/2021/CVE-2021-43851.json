An upgrade is highly recommended. If an upgrade is not practical, introduce ttValidStatus function as in the latest version and start using it user input check blocks wherever status field is used. For groups.php fix, introduce ttValidInteger function as in the latest version and use it in the access check block in the file.", "VENDOR": ["anuko", "anuko$PRODUCT$time_tracker"]}
