This vulnerability is due to incorrect error handling when an affected device receives an unexpected 802.11 frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain 802.11 frames over the wireless network to an interface on an affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet buffer leak. This could eventually result in buffer allocation failures, which would trigger a reload of the affected device.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
