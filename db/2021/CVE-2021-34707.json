This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to an API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific API request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the application.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$evolved_programmable_network_manager"]}
