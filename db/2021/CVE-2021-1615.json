This vulnerability is due to insufficient buffer allocation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available resources and cause a DoS condition on an affected AP, as well as a DoS condition for client traffic traversing the AP.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130", "cisco$PRODUCT$embedded_wireless_controller"]}
