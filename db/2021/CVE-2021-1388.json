The vulnerability is due to improper token validation on a specific API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to receive a token with administrator-level privileges that could be used to authenticate to the API on affected MSO and managed Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$aci_multi-site_orchestrator", "cisco$PRODUCT$application_policy_infrastructure_controller"]}
