This flaw allows a local user on a vulnerable system to unmount other users' filesystems that are either world-writable themselves (like /tmp) or mounted in a world-writable directory. An attacker may use this flaw to cause a denial of service to applications that use the affected filesystems.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "kernel", "kernel$PRODUCT$util-linux"]}
