These parameters were not protected by the no_log feature. An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those credentials, provided when they have access to the log files containing them. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform in versions before 1.2.2 and Ansible Tower in versions before 3.8.2.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$ansible", "redhat$PRODUCT$ansible_tower"]}
