This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set.", "VENDOR": ["gargoyle-router", "gargoyle-router$PRODUCT$gargoyle"]}
