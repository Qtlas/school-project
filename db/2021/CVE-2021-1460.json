This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$809_industrial_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$829_industrial_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$cgr1000", "cisco$PRODUCT$cgr1000_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ic3000_industrial_compute_gateway", "cisco$PRODUCT$ic3000_industrial_compute_gateway_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios"]}
