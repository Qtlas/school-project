This vulnerability is due to ineffective access control. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an SNMPv3 query to an affected device from a host that is not permitted by the SNMPv3 access control list. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send an SNMP query to an affected device and retrieve information from the device. The attacker would need valid credentials to perform the SNMP query.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5505_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5512-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5515-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5525-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5545-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5555-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5580_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_5585-x_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
