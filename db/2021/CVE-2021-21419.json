A websocket peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.", "PRODUIT": ["eventlet", "eventlet$PRODUCT$eventlet", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora"]}
