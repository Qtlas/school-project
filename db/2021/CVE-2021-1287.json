The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv132w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv132w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv134w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv134w_firmware"]}
