The vulnerability exists because confidential information is included in HTTP requests that are exchanged between the user and the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by looking at the raw HTTP requests that are sent to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain some of the passwords that are configured throughout the interface.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asyncos", "cisco$PRODUCT$content_security_management_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$email_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$ironport_web_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$web_security_appliance"]}
