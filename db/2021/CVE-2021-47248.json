Both\nracing functions acquire the socket lock, but udp{v6}_destroy_sock()\nrelease it before performing destructive actions.\n\nWe can't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race,\ninstead use the SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent udp_abort from doing\nany action when the critical race happens.\n\nDiagnosed-and-tested-by: Kaustubh Pandey <kapandey@codeaurora.org>", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
