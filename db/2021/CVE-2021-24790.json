The delete_cf7_data would lead to arbitrary metadata deletion, as well as PHP Object Injection if a suitable gadget chain is present in another plugin, as user data is passed to the maybe_unserialize() function without being first validated.", "VENDOR": ["contact_form_advanced_database_project", "contact_form_advanced_database_project$PRODUCT$contact_form_advanced_database"]}
