These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP requests are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345p", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345p_firmware"]}
