Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a size variable, stored as an signed int, to equal an extremely large value, which is interpreted as a negative value during a check. This value is then used in a memcpy call on the stack, causing a memory segmentation fault.", "PRODUIT": ["fisglobal", "fisglobal$PRODUCT$gt.m"]}
