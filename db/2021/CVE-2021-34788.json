This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the signature verification process for shared library files that are loaded on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a valid account on the system.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$anyconnect_secure_mobility_client", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
