The \"none\" algorithm does not require any signature verification when validating the ID tokens, which allows the attacker to bypass the token validation by injecting a malformed ID token using \"none\" as the value of \"alg\" key in the header with an empty signature value.", "VENDOR": ["pac4j", "pac4j$PRODUCT$pac4j"]}
