The problem was in\nnon-freed perfect hash in tcindex_partial_destroy_work().\n\nIn tcindex_set_parms() new tcindex_data is allocated and some fields from\nold one are copied to new one, but not the perfect hash. Since\ntcindex_partial_destroy_work() is the destroy function for old\ntcindex_data, we need to free perfect hash to avoid memory leak.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
