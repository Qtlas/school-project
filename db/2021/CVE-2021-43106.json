Any changes made to the header would just cause the request to be sent to a completely different Domain/IP address. This is due to that the server implicitly trusts the Host header, and fails to validate or escape it properly. An attacker can use this input to redirect target users to a malicious domain/web page. This would result in expanding the potential to further attacks and malicious actions.", "PRODUIT": ["compassplus", "compassplus$PRODUCT$tranzware_online", "compassplus$PRODUCT$tranzware_online_financial_institution_maintenance_interface"]}
