The issue is how the FTP client trusts the host from the PASV response by default. This flaw allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which otherwise would not have been possible.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$ontap_select_deploy_administration_utility", "python", "python$PRODUCT$python", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$software_collections"]}
