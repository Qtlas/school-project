It mishandles situations in which an array size (derived from a /Size entry) is smaller than the maximum indirect object number, and thus there is an attempted incorrect array access (leading to a NULL pointer dereference, or out-of-bounds read or write).", "VENDOR": ["foxit", "foxit$PRODUCT$pdf_reader", "foxitsoftware", "foxitsoftware$PRODUCT$pdf_editor"]}
