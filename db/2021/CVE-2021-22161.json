This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set. This affects the netifd and odhcp6c packages.", "VENDOR": ["openwrt", "openwrt$PRODUCT$openwrt"]}
