To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the \"shards\" parameter. Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not. This problem affects essentially all Solr versions prior to it getting fixed in 8.8.2.", "PRODUIT": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$solr"]}
