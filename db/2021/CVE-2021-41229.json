In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.", "VENDOR": ["bluez", "bluez$PRODUCT$bluez", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
