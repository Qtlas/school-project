The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$peoplesoft_enterprise_peopletools", "python", "python$PRODUCT$urllib3"]}
