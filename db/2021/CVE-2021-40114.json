The vulnerability is due to improper memory resource management while the Snort detection engine is processing ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of ICMP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device, causing the device to reload.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_management_center", "cisco$PRODUCT$unified_threat_defense", "snort", "snort$PRODUCT$snort"]}
