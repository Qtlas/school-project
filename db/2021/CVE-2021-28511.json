The impact of this vulnerability is that the security ACL drop rule might be bypassed if a NAT ACL rule filter with permit action matches the packet flow. This could allow a host with an IP address in a range that matches the range allowed by a NAT ACL and a range denied by a Security ACL to be forwarded incorrectly as it should have been denied by the Security ACL. This can enable an ACL bypass.", "PRODUIT": ["arista", "arista$PRODUCT$7050cx3-32s", "arista$PRODUCT$7050cx3m-32s", "arista$PRODUCT$7050sx3-48c8", "arista$PRODUCT$7050sx3-48yc", "arista$PRODUCT$7050sx3-48yc12", "arista$PRODUCT$7050sx3-48yc8", "arista$PRODUCT$7050sx3-96yc8", "arista$PRODUCT$7050tx3-48c8", "arista$PRODUCT$720xp-24y6", "arista$PRODUCT$720xp-24zy4", "arista$PRODUCT$720xp-48y6", "arista$PRODUCT$720xp-48zc2", "arista$PRODUCT$720xp-96zc2", "arista$PRODUCT$7300x3-32c", "arista$PRODUCT$7300x3-48yc4", "arista$PRODUCT$eos"]}
