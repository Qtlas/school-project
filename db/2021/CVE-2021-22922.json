In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$curl", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$cloud_backup", "netapp$PRODUCT$clustered_data_ontap", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300e", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300e_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500e", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500e_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700e", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700e_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci_management_node", "netapp$PRODUCT$solidfire", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$mysql_server", "siemens", "siemens$PRODUCT$sinec_infrastructure_network_services", "splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$universal_forwarder"]}
