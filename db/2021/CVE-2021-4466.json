The email configuration component inserts user-controlled values, including the EMAIL_PW parameter, directly into system-level operations without proper input sanitation. By modifying the email password field to include shell metacharacters and issuing a save-and-test-mail action, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web interface, resulting in full system compromise.", "VENDOR": []}
