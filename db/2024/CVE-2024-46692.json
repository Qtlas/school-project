When two\nSMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to\nresume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is\ninterrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated\na waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.\n\nTo avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standard\nSMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
