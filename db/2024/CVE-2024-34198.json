The formWlEncrypt CGI handler in the boa program fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input. This allows attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests by supplying an excessively long value for the wlan_ssid field, leading to a stack overflow. This can be further exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch denial-of-service attacks.", "VENDOR": ["totolink", "totolink$PRODUCT$a3002ru", "totolink$PRODUCT$a3002ru_firmware"]}
