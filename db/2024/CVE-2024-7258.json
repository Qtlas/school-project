This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "PRODUIT": ["wpmarketingrobot", "wpmarketingrobot$PRODUCT$woocommerce_google_feed_manager"]}
