The issue arises when the denylist is configured to block specific commands, such as 'whoami' and '/bin/whoami'. An attacker can circumvent this restriction by executing commands with a modified path, such as '/bin/./whoami', which is not recognized by the denylist.", "VENDOR": ["agpt", "agpt$PRODUCT$autogpt_classic"]}
