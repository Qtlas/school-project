This issue can be triggered if an unauthenticated remote attacker tricks a user into parsing a devfile which uses the `parent` or `plugin` keywords. This could download a malicious archive and cause the cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside of the archive, which should not be allowed.", "PRODUIT": ["devfile", "devfile$PRODUCT$registry-support", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_developer_tools_and_services"]}
