All files in the install inherit the file permissions of the parent directory and therefore a non-privileged user can substitute any executable for the nssm.exe service. A subsequent service or server restart will then run that binary with administrator privilege.", "PRODUIT": ["ibm", "ibm$PRODUCT$robotic_process_automation"]}
