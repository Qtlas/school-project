An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view HTTP proxy server admin credentials in clear text that are configured on Nexus Dashboard to reach an external network.\r\nNote: Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_dashboard_fabric_controller", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_dashboard_insights", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_dashboard_orchestrator"]}
