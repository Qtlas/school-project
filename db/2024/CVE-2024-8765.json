The system incorrectly identifies certain endpoints as public if the path contains '/auth/' anywhere within it. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive endpoints by including '/auth/' in the path. As a result, attackers can obtain and modify sensitive data and utilize other organizations' resources without proper authentication.", "PRODUIT": ["lunary", "lunary$PRODUCT$lunary"]}
