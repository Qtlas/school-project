This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.", "VENDOR": ["wpwebelite", "wpwebelite$PRODUCT$woocommerce_social_login"]}
