Starting in version 11.0.0 and prior to version 11.3.0, when setting `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` to \"public\", an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges. This impacts any Directus instance that has either `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` set to `public` allowing unauthenticated users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions. Version 11.3.0 fixes the issue.", "PRODUIT": "monospace"}
