When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister is called to stop further write-back and waits for associated delayed work to complete. However, wb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation work after this has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the recently freed bdi_writeback.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
