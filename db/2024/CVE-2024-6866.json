This results in a mismatch because paths in URLs are case-sensitive, but the regex matching treats them as case-insensitive. This misconfiguration can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized origins to access paths meant to be restricted, resulting in data exposure and potential data leaks.", "VENDOR": ["flask-cors_project", "flask-cors_project$PRODUCT$flask-cors"]}
