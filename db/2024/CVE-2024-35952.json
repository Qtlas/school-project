This is because the register, VGACRI-Dx, checked in\nthis API is a scratch register actually controlled by a MCU, named\nDPMCU, in BMC.\n\nThese scratch registers are protected by scu-lock. If suc-lock is not\noff, DPMCU can not update these registers and then host will have soft\nlockup due to never updated status.\n\nDPMCU is used to control DP and relative registers to handshake with\nhost's VGA driver. Even the most time-consuming task, DP's link\ntraining, is less than 100ms. 200ms should be enough.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
