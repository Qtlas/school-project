If set, requires that LE Secure Connections is used for read/write access, however this is only true when it is combined with other permissions, namely BT_GATT_PERM_READ_ENCRYPT/BT_GATT_PERM_READ_AUTHEN (for read) or BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_ENCRYPT/BT_GATT_PERM_WRITE_AUTHEN (for write), if these additional permissions are not set (even in secure connections only mode) then the stack does not perform any permission checks on these characteristics and they can be freely written/read.", "PRODUIT": ["zephyrproject", "zephyrproject$PRODUCT$zephyr"]}
