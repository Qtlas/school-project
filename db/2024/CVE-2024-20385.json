An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using machine-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and Cisco NDO and then using a crafted certificate to impersonate the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn sensitive information during communications between these devices.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$nexus_dashboard_orchestrator"]}
