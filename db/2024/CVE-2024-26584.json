For example, when\nthe cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an\nartificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued\nto the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback\nwill also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it\nseems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.\n\nCompared to Sabrina's original patch this version uses the new\ntls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts the EBUSY to\nEINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error handling\npaths. The handling is identical.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
