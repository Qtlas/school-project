This will cause a memory leak.\n\nMemory leak issues in ax25_dev_device_down():\n\nThe reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 in ax25_dev_device_up() and\nthen increase the reference count when ax25_dev is added to ax25_dev_list.\nAs a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2. But when the device is\nshutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count once\nor twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause\nmemory leak.\n\nAs for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), it is impossible for one pointer\nto be on a list twice. So add a break in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for the\nissue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increase the reference count of ax25_dev\nonce in ax25_dev_device_up() and decrease the reference count of ax25_dev\nafter it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
