An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overflow an internal buffer and execute arbitrary commands at the root privilege level.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_301_1_line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_301_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_303_3_line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_303_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_501g_8-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_501g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_502g_1-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_502g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_504g_4-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_504g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_508g_8-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_508g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_509g_12-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_509g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_512g_1-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_512g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_514g_4-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_514g_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_525g2_5-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_525g2_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_525g_5-line_ip_phone", "cisco$PRODUCT$spa_525g_firmware"]}
