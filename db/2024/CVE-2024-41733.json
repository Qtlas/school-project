{"CVE": "CVE-2024-41733", "CWE": ["CWE-200", "NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2024-08-13T04:15:08", "CVSS": 5.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "Information Disclosure Vulnerability in SAP Commerce", "DESC": "In SAP Commerce, valid user accounts can be\nidentified during the customer registration and login processes. This allows a\npotential attacker to learn if a given e-mail is used for an account, but does\nnot grant access to any customer data beyond this knowledge. The attacker must\nalready know the e-mail that they wish to test for. The impact on\nconfidentiality therefore is low and no impact to integrity or availability", "VENDOR": ["sap", "sap$PRODUCT$commerce"]}
