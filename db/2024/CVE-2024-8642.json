The issue requires to have a dataplane configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module \"transfer-data-plane\". The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane Signaling. In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed.", "PRODUIT": ["eclipse", "eclipse$PRODUCT$eclipse_dataspace_components"]}
