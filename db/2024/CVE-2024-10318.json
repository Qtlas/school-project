This flaw allows an attacker to fix a victim's session to an attacker-controlled account. As a result, although the attacker cannot log in as the victim, they can force the session to associate it with the attacker-controlled account, leading to potential misuse of the victim's session.", "VENDOR": ["f5", "f5$PRODUCT$nginx_api_connectivity_manager", "f5$PRODUCT$nginx_ingress_controller", "f5$PRODUCT$nginx_instance_manager", "f5$PRODUCT$nginx_openid_connect"]}
