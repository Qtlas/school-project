This is due to the use of loose comparison of the activation code in the 'woo_slg_confirm_email_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the userID. This requires the email module to be enabled.", "PRODUIT": ["wpwebelite", "wpwebelite$PRODUCT$woocommerce_social_login"]}
