An HTTP/2 SSL connection that is established and TCP congested will be leaked when it times out. An attacker can cause many connections to end up in this state, and the server may run out of file descriptors, eventually causing the server to stop accepting new connections from valid clients. The vulnerability is patched in 9.4.54, 10.0.20, 11.0.20, and 12.0.6.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "eclipse", "eclipse$PRODUCT$jetty", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$bluexp"]}
