This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what user meta values can be updated and ensuring a form is active. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update their user meta to become an administrator.", "VENDOR": ["pickplugins", "pickplugins$PRODUCT$post_grid"]}
