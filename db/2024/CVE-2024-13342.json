This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files with double extensions on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable on select instances where the configuration will execute the first extension present.", "VENDOR": ["booster", "booster$PRODUCT$booster_for_woocommerce"]}
