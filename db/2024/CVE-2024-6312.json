This is due to the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible.", "PRODUIT": ["funnelforms", "funnelforms$PRODUCT$funnelforms_free"]}
