An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP request through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: The attack vector is listed as network because a DHCP relay anywhere on the network could allow exploits from networks other than the adjacent one.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9100", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105axw", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9105w", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115_ap", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9115axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117_ap", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9117axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120_ap", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9120axp", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124axd", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124d", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9124i", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130_ap", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axe", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9130axi", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9136", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9162", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9164", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9166", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9166d1", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9200", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9200cx", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9200l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24p-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24p-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24s-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24s-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24t-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24t-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24u-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24u-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24ux-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-24ux-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48p-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48p-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48s-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48s-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48t-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48t-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48u-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48u-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48un-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48un-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48uxm-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300-48uxm-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24p-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-24t-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48p-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4g-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4g-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4x-a", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l-48t-4x-e", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300l_stack", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300lm", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9300x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9400", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9407r", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9600x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-c", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l-f", "cisco$PRODUCT$dn-apl-tta-m", "cisco$PRODUCT$dn-apl-tta-m-rf", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
