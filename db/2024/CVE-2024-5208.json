{"CVE": "CVE-2024-5208", "CWE": ["CWE-770", "NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2024-06-19 06:15:11", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in mintplex-labs/anything-llm", "DESC": "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": "mintplexlabs"}
