If during this process, the interface flaps,\u00a0an\u00a0Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt) core is observed. This leads to a PFE restart. The crash reoccurs if the same sequence of events happens, which will lead to a sustained DoS condition.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\u00a023.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.", "PRODUIT": ["juniper", "juniper$PRODUCT$junos_os_evolved"]}
