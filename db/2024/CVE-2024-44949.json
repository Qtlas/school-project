If\none of these allocations is written using DMA and the other is written\nusing cached write, the value that was written with DMA may be\ncorrupted.\n\nThis commit changes ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to be 128 on PA20 and 32 on PA1.1 -\nthat's the largest possible cache line size.\n\nAs different parisc microarchitectures have different cache line size, we\ndefine arch_slab_minalign(), cache_line_size() and\ndma_get_cache_alignment() so that the kernel may tune slab cache\nparameters dynamically, based on the detected cache line size.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
