This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them through the sb_login_user_with_otp_fun() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary users, including administrators.", "VENDOR": ["scriptsbundle", "scriptsbundle$PRODUCT$adforest"]}
