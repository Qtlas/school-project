This is due to the use of loose comparison in the 'verify_id_token' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to an @flutter.io email address or phone number. This also requires firebase to be configured on the website and the user to have set up firebase for their account.", "VENDOR": ["inspireui", "inspireui$PRODUCT$mstore_api"]}
