In environments where the feature is enabled, due to missing access check enforcements, non-administrative CloudStack user accounts are able to access and modify quota-related configurations and data. This issue affects Apache CloudStack from 4.7.0 through 4.18.2.3; and from 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, where the Quota feature is enabled.\n\n\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue.\u00a0Alternatively, users that do not use the Quota feature are advised to disabled the plugin by setting the global setting \"quota.enable.service\" to \"false\".", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$cloudstack"]}
