Upon adding a new URL, the system retrieves the last sysmapelementurlid value and increments it by one. However, an issue arises when a user manually changes the sysmapelementurlid value by adding sysmapelementurlid + 1. This action prevents others from adding URLs to the map element.", "VENDOR": ["zabbix", "zabbix$PRODUCT$zabbix"]}
