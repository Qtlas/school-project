This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: The FileOrganizer Pro plugin must be installed and active to allow Subscriber+ users to upload files.", "VENDOR": ["fileorganizer", "fileorganizer$PRODUCT$fileorganizer"]}
