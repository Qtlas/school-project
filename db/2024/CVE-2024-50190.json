Copy just the topology section, and only when\nneeded. Reuse the buffer allocated for the read of the current topology.\n\nThis was found by kmemleak, with the following trace for each PF:\n    [<ffffffff8761044d>] kmemdup_noprof+0x1d/0x50\n    [<ffffffffc0a0a480>] ice_init_ddp_config+0x100/0x220 [ice]\n    [<ffffffffc0a0da7f>] ice_init_dev+0x6f/0x200 [ice]\n    [<ffffffffc0a0dc49>] ice_init+0x29/0x560 [ice]\n    [<ffffffffc0a10c1d>] ice_probe+0x21d/0x310 [ice]\n\nConstify ice_cfg_tx_topo() @buf parameter.\nThis cascades further down to few more functions.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
