Such an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access to the broker IP address list.\n\nTo mitigate these security threats, it is strongly advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0.", "PRODUIT": "apache"}
