This disclosure could then lead to additional brute-force password-guessing attacks. This vulnerability would require that the Splunk platform instance uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication scheme.", "VENDOR": ["splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$splunk_cloud_platform"]}
