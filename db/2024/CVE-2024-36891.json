This will lead to a null pointer dereference when checking\ninformation in the NULL node, which is done in mas_data_end().\n\nAvoid setting the offset if there is no node by waiting until after the\nmaple state is checked for an empty or single entry state.\n\nA user could trigger the events to cause a kernel oops by unmapping all\nvmas to produce an empty maple tree, then mapping a vma that would cause\nthe scenario described above.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
