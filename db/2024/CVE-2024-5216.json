{"CVE": "CVE-2024-5216", "CWE": ["CWE-400", "NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2024-06-25T11:15:50", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Denial of Service in mintplex-labs/anything-llm", "DESC": "A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance.", "VENDOR": ["mintplexlabs", "mintplexlabs$PRODUCT$anythingllm"]}
