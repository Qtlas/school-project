A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.7.5 affects authenticated administrators with sites that have the `media.clean_vectors` configuration enabled. This configuration will sanitize SVG files uploaded using the media manager. This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass this protection by uploading it with a permitted extension (for example, .jpg or .png) and later modifying it to the .svg extension. This vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user. This issue has been patched in v3.7.5.", "PRODUIT": ["octobercms", "octobercms$PRODUCT$october"]}
