This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This can also be used by unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts.", "VENDOR": ["wpmarketingrobot", "wpmarketingrobot$PRODUCT$woocommerce_google_feed_manager"]}
