This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email via the account_settings_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "PRODUIT": ["chimpgroup", "chimpgroup$PRODUCT$jobcareer"]}
