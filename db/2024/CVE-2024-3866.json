This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires \"maintenance mode\" for a targeted form to be enabled. However, there is no setting available to the attacker or even an administrator-level user to enable this mode. The mode is only enabled during a required update, which is a very short window of time. Additionally, because of the self-based nature of this vulnerability, attackers would have to rely on additional techniques to execute a supplied payload in the context of targeted user.", "VENDOR": ["ninjaforms", "ninjaforms$PRODUCT$ninja_forms"]}
