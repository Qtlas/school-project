However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations.", "VENDOR": ["lunary", "lunary$PRODUCT$lunary"]}
