The number of max login attempts is supposed to be  limited by a configuration parameter `MaxLoginRetry` in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini`. However, this mechanism was not effectively working. As a result, xrdp allows an infinite number of login attempts. ", "VENDOR": ["neutrinolabs", "neutrinolabs$PRODUCT$xrdp"]}
