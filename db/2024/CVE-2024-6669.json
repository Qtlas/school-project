This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "PRODUIT": ["quantumcloud", "quantumcloud$PRODUCT$wpbot"]}
