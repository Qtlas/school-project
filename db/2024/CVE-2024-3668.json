This is due to the plugin not restricting low privileged users from setting a default role for a registration form. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration form with administrator set as the default role and then register as an administrator.", "VENDOR": ["ideabox", "ideabox$PRODUCT$powerpack_addons_for_elementor"]}
