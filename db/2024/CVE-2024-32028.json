{"CVE": "CVE-2024-32028", "CWE": ["CWE-201", "CWE-212"], "DATE": "2024-04-12T23:15:06", "CVSS": 4.1, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "Sensitive query parameters logged by default in OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation http and AspNetCore", "DESC": "OpenTelemetry dotnet is a dotnet telemetry framework. In affected versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` the `url.full` writes attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests. These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents. Note: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability. The `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": []}
