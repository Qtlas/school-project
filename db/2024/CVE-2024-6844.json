{"CVE": "CVE-2024-6844", "CWE": ["CWE-346"], "DATE": "2025-03-20T10:15:34", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Inconsistent CORS Matching Due to Handling of '+' in URL Path in corydolphin/flask-cors", "DESC": "A vulnerability in corydolphin/flask-cors version 4.0.1 allows for inconsistent CORS matching due to the handling of the '+' character in URL paths. The request.path is passed through the unquote_plus function, which converts the '+' character to a space ' '. This behavior leads to incorrect path normalization, causing potential mismatches in CORS configuration. As a result, endpoints may not be matched correctly to their CORS settings, leading to unexpected CORS policy application. This can cause unauthorized cross-origin access or block valid requests, creating security vulnerabilities and usability issues.", "VENDOR": ["flask-cors_project", "flask-cors_project$PRODUCT$flask-cors"]}
