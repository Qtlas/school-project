An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device at a rate that exceeds a configured rate filter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to successfully bypass the rate filter. This could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$snort"]}
