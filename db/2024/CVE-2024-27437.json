This presents a window where the interrupt could fire between\nthese events, resulting in the IRQ incrementing the disable depth twice.\nThis would be unrecoverable for a user since the masked flag prevents\nnested enables through vfio.\n\nInstead, invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive INTx\nis never auto-enabled, then unmask as required.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
