An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 packet either to or through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to be associated with the affected AP. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending IPv6 packets.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_140ac", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_140ac_access_point", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_141acm", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_142acm", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_143acm", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_145ac", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_145ac_access_point", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_150ax", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_150ax_access_point", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_151axm", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_240ac", "cisco$PRODUCT$business_access_points", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe", "cisco$PRODUCT$wireless_lan_controller_software"]}
