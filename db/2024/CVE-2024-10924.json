This is due to improper user check error handling in the two-factor REST API actions with the 'check_login_and_get_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, when the \"Two-Factor Authentication\" setting is enabled (disabled by default).", "PRODUIT": ["really-simple-plugins", "really-simple-plugins$PRODUCT$really_simple_security"]}
