As a\nresult, passing a negative length accidentally succeeds in truncating\nto file size between 2GiB and 4GiB.\n\nChanging the type of the compat syscall to the signed compat_off_t\nchanges the behavior so it instead returns -EINVAL.\n\nThe native entry point, the truncate() syscall and the corresponding\nloff_t based variants are all correct already and do not suffer\nfrom this mistake.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
