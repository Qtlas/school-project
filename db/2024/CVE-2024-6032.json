This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Tesla Model S vehicles. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n \nThe specific flaw exists within the ql_atfwd process. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code on the target modem in the context of root.
