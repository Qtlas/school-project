Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by using a fragment component `#` in the artifact location URI to read arbitrary files on the server in the context of the server's process. This issue is similar to CVE-2023-6909 but utilizes a different component of the URI to achieve the same effect. ", "PRODUIT": ["lfprojects", "lfprojects$PRODUCT$mlflow"]}
