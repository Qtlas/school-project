This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to generate a verification link for any unverified user and log into the account. The 'Fine tune placement' option must be enabled in the plugin settings in order to exploit the vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["wpfactory", "wpfactory$PRODUCT$customer_email_verification_for_woocommerce"]}
