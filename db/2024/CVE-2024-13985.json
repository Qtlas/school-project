The flaw stems from improper input validation in the captureCommand parameter, which is processed without sanitization or authentication. By sending crafted HTTP requests, attackers can inject OS-level commands that are executed on the server, leading to full system compromise.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-04-06 UTC.", "VENDOR": []}
