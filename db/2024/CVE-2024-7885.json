This issue occurs when the parseProxyProtocolV1 method processes multiple requests on the same HTTP connection. As a result, different requests may share the same StringBuilder instance, potentially leading to information leakage between requests or responses. In some cases, a value from a previous request or response may be erroneously reused, which could lead to unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors and connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request environments.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$build_of_apache_camel_-_hawtio", "redhat$PRODUCT$build_of_apache_camel_for_spring_boot", "redhat$PRODUCT$build_of_keycloak", "redhat$PRODUCT$data_grid", "redhat$PRODUCT$integration_camel_k", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_enterprise_application_platform", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_fuse", "redhat$PRODUCT$process_automation", "redhat$PRODUCT$single_sign-on"]}
