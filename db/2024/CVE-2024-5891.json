If an attacker can obtain the client ID for an application, they can use an OAuth token to authenticate despite not having access to the organization from which the application was created. This issue is limited to authentication and not authorization. However, in configurations where endpoints rely only on authentication, a user may authenticate to applications they otherwise have no access to.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$quay"]}
