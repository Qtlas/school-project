This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable when used in conjunction with a race condition as the uploaded file is deleted shortly after it is created.", "VENDOR": ["fastlinemedia", "fastlinemedia$PRODUCT$customizer_export\\/import"]}
