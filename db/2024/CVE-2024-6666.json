This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Accounting Manager access (erp_ac_view_sales_summary capability) and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.", "VENDOR": ["wedevs", "wedevs$PRODUCT$wp_erp"]}
