An attacker can exploit the 'item' parameter in a POST request to execute arbitrary SQL commands in the backend database. This can be done by injecting specially crafted SQL queries that make the database perform time-consuming operations, thereby confirming the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability based on the delay in the server's response.", "VENDOR": ["anujk305", "anujk305$PRODUCT$daily_expenses_management_system"]}
