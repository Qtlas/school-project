Specifically, by crafting a request with a manipulated `model` parameter, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and target files outside of the intended directory, leading to the deletion of sensitive data. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `model` parameter.", "VENDOR": ["mudler", "mudler$PRODUCT$localai"]}
