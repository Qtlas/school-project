The endpoint does not mitigate path traversal when handling user-specified run-names, which are used to specify log/metadata files for deletion. This can be exploited to delete arbitrary files or directories, potentially causing denial of service or data loss.", "PRODUIT": ["aimstack", "aimstack$PRODUCT$aim"]}
