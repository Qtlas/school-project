{"CVE": "CVE-2024-22195", "CWE": ["CWE-79"], "DATE": "2024-01-11 03:15:11", "SCORE": 5.4, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Jinja vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "DESC": "Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr` filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML attribute keys and values, bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially leading to XSS. It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they are blacklist-based.", "PRODUIT": "palletsprojects"}
