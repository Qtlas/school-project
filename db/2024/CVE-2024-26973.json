However the length of the\nfile handle must be a multiple of 4 so the file handle is actually 12\nbytes long and the last two bytes remain uninitialized. This is not\ngreat at we potentially leak uninitialized information with the handle\nto userspace. Properly initialize the full handle length.", "VENDOR": []}
