This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This requires responsive videos to be enabled for posts.", "PRODUIT": ["kirstyburgoine", "kirstyburgoine$PRODUCT$responsive_video"]}
