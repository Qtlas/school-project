By manipulating a DOM element through a crafted URL or user input, the high-privileged attacker can inject malicious scripts that run when the page is rendered. This type of attack requires user interaction, as the victim would need to visit a malicious link or input data into a compromised form. A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high.", "PRODUIT": "adobe"}
