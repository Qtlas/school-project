This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. While 4.10.32 is patched, it is recommended to update to 4.10.33 because 4.10.32 caused a fatal error.", "PRODUIT": ["leap13", "leap13$PRODUCT$premium_addons_for_elementor"]}
