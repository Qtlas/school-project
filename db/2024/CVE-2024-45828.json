Depending on timing between ring stop request\ncompletion, interrupt handler removal and code execution this may lead\nto a NULL pointer dereference in hci_dma_irq_handler() if it gets to run\nafter the io_data pointer is set to NULL in hci_dma_cleanup().\n\nPrevent this my masking the ring interrupts before ring stop request.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
