This can be used to craft a custom firmware file with a custom script with arbitrary code, which will then be executed on the charging station.", "DESC": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability allows OS Command Injection as root\n\nThis issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers before version 24120701.\n\nLikelihood: High. However, the attacker will need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the action.exe CGI binary and upload the crafted firmware file, or convince a user with such access to upload it.\n\nImpact: Critical \u2013 The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and deletefiles and services.\n\nCVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, but the level of authentication does not matter (PR:L), nor is any user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a full compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H), and compromised devices can be used to pivot into networks that should potentially not be accessible (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P). This attack can be automated (AU:Y).", "VENDOR": []}
