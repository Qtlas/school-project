{"CVE": "CVE-2024-31083", "CWE": ["CWE-416"], "DATE": "2024-04-05T12:15:37", "CVSS": 7.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Xorg-x11-server: use-after-free in procrenderaddglyphs", "DESC": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.", "VENDOR": []}
