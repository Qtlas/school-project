By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator.", "VENDOR": ["mintplexlabs", "mintplexlabs$PRODUCT$anythingllm"]}
