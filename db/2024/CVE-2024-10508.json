This is due to the plugin not properly validating the password reset token prior to updating a user's password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of arbitrary users, including administrators, and gain access to these accounts.", "VENDOR": ["metagauss", "metagauss$PRODUCT$registrationmagic"]}
