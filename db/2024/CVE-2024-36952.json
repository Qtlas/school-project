This occurs when a vport is\nunregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the\nfabric.\n\nCurrently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including\nthe fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport\nobject.  This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID and\nLOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.\n\nFix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID\nand LOGO are sent.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
