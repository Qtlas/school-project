In Firefox this only affects the QUIC header protection feature when the connection is using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suite. The most likely outcome is connection failure, but if the connection persists despite the high packet loss it could be possible for a network observer to identify packets as coming from the same source despite a network path change. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 129, Firefox ESR < 115.14, and Firefox ESR < 128.1.", "VENDOR": ["mozilla", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox_esr"]}
