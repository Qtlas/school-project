{"CVE": "CVE-2024-8060", "CWE": ["CWE-22"], "DATE": "2025-03-20T10:15:40", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Remote Code Execution in OpenWebUI via Arbitrary File Upload", "DESC": "OpenWebUI version 0.3.0 contains a vulnerability in the audio API endpoint `/audio/api/v1/transcriptions` that allows for arbitrary file upload. The application performs insufficient validation on the `file.content_type` and allows user-controlled filenames, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. This can be exploited by an authenticated user to overwrite critical files within the Docker container, potentially leading to remote code execution as the root user.", "VENDOR": []}
