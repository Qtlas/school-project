The vulnerability requires the \u201cdelete_prev_date\u201d theme option being enabled. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access or above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing query that can be used to extract sensitive information such as passwords from the database.", "VENDOR": ["wpdevart", "wpdevart$PRODUCT$booking_calendar"]}
