This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Delta Electronics DRASimuCAD. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of STP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22450.", "VENDOR": ["deltaww", "deltaww$PRODUCT$drasimucad"]}
