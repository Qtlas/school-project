Before 6.3.0, general users can access information that can only be accessed by users with access privileges to admin and support information (SETTINGS_SUPPORT). This is due to inadequate access control for support information (http://<opencti_domain>/storage/get/support/UUID/UUID.zip), and that the UUID is available to general users using an attached query (logs query). This vulnerability is fixed in 6.3.0.", "PRODUIT": ["citeum", "citeum$PRODUCT$opencti"]}
