The endpoint uses a user-specified string to construct a regular expression, which is then applied to another user-specified string. By sending multiple simultaneous requests, an attacker can exhaust all available threads, leading to a complete denial of service.", "VENDOR": ["h2o", "h2o$PRODUCT$h2o"]}
