This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "PRODUIT": ["vanquish", "vanquish$PRODUCT$woocommerce_support_ticket_system"]}
