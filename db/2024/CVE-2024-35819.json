So we need to use a raw spinlock\nfor cgr_lock to ensure we aren't waiting on a sleeping task.\n\nAlthough this bug has existed for a while, it was not apparent until\ncommit ef2a8d5478b9 (\"net: dpaa: Adjust queue depth on rate change\")\nwhich invokes smp_call_function_single via qman_update_cgr_safe every\ntime a link goes up or down.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
