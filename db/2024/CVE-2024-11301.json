{"CVE": "CVE-2024-11301", "CWE": ["CWE-837"], "DATE": "2025-03-20 10:15:24", "SCORE": "", "METRIC": "", "TITLE": "Improper Enforcement of Unique Constraint in lunary-ai/lunary", "DESC": "In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.6.3, the application allows the creation of evaluators without enforcing a unique constraint on the combination of projectId and slug. This allows an attacker to overwrite existing data by submitting a POST request with the same slug as an existing evaluator. The lack of database constraints or application-layer validation to prevent duplicates exposes the application to data integrity issues. This vulnerability can result in corrupted data and potentially malicious actions, impairing the system's functionality.", "PRODUIT": ["lunary", "lunary$PRODUCT$lunary"]}
