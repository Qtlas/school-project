The intent here is\nclearly just to reset the length to zero before resubmitting, so switch to\ncalling __skb_set_length(skb, 0) directly. In addition, __skb_set_length()\nalready contains a call to skb_reset_tail_pointer(), so remove the redundant\ncall.\n\nThe syzbot report came from ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb(), but there's a similar\nusage of skb_trim() in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb(), change both while we're at it.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
