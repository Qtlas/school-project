This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to read and delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "PRODUIT": ["bitapps", "bitapps$PRODUCT$contact_form_builder"]}
