If there is a cookie mismatch, then\n   this skbuff needs to be parsed again.\n\n3) Finally, validate if the percpu area refers to this tunnel type.\n\nOnly after these three checks the percpu area is restored to a on-stack\ncopy and bh is enabled again.\n\nAfter inner header fetching, the on-stack copy is stored back to the\npercpu area.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
