Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.", "PRODUIT": ["argoproj", "argoproj$PRODUCT$argo_cd"]}
