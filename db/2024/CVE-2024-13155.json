This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn't part of the code base, to apply the patch, the affected widget: Transparent Split Hero must be deleted and reinstalled manually.", "VENDOR": ["unlimited-elements", "unlimited-elements$PRODUCT$unlimited_elements_for_elementor"]}
