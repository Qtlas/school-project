So, accessing them requires mutual exclusion using\nthe reader/writer semaphore \"nilfs->ns_sem\".\n\nSome sysfs attribute show methods read this superblock buffer without the\nnecessary mutual exclusion, which can cause problems with pointer\ndereferencing and memory access, so fix it.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
