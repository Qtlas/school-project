This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.", "VENDOR": ["pluginus", "pluginus$PRODUCT$inpost_gallery"]}
