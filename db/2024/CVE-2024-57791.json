Once the value of length exceeds\nthe value of buflen in function smc_clc_wait_msg it may run into deadloop\nwhen trying to drain the remaining data exceeding buflen.\n\nThis patch checks the return value of sock_recvmsg when draining data in\ncase of deadloop in draining.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
