{"CVE": "CVE-2024-10306", "CWE": ["CWE-863"], "DATE": "2025-04-23T10:15:14", "CVSS": 5.4, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Mod_proxy_cluster: mod_proxy_cluster unauthorized mcmp requests", "DESC": "A vulnerability was found in mod_proxy_cluster. The issue is that the <Directory> directive should be replaced by the <Location> directive as the former does not restrict IP/host access as `Require ip IP_ADDRESS` would suggest. This means that anyone with access to the host might send MCMP requests that may result in adding/removing/updating nodes for the balancing. However, this host should not be accessible to the public network as it does not serve the general traffic.", "VENDOR": []}
