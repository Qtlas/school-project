{"CVE": "CVE-2024-12216", "CWE": ["CWE-59"], "DATE": "2025-03-20T10:15:27.450000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Arbitrary File Write via TarSlip in dmlc/gluon-cv", "DESC": "A vulnerability in the `ImageClassificationDataset.from_csv()` API of the `dmlc/gluon-cv` repository, version 0.10.0, allows for arbitrary file write. The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a TarSlip vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victim's system via path traversal or faked symlinks.", "VENDOR": []}
