{"CVE": "CVE-2024-1753", "CWE": ["CWE-59"], "DATE": "2024-03-18T15:15:41", "CVSS": 8.6, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Buildah: full container escape at build time", "DESC": "A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which allows containers to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem into build containers. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container escape at build time.", "VENDOR": []}
