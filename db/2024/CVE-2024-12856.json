At least firmware version 2.0 allows authenticated and remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands over HTTP when modifying the system time via apply.cgi. Additionally, this firmware version has default credentials which, if not changed, would effectively change this vulnerability into an unauthenticated and remote OS command execution issue.", "VENDOR": ["four-faith", "four-faith$PRODUCT$f3x24", "four-faith$PRODUCT$f3x24_firmware", "four-faith$PRODUCT$f3x36", "four-faith$PRODUCT$f3x36_firmware"]}
