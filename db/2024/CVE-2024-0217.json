In some conditions, the order of cleanup mechanics for a transaction could be impacted. As a result, some memory access could occur on memory regions that were previously freed. Once freed, a memory region can be reused for other allocations and any previously stored data in this memory region is considered lost.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "packagekit_project", "packagekit_project$PRODUCT$packagekit", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
