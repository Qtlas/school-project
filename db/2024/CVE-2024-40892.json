{"CVE": "CVE-2024-40892", "CWE": ["CWE-1391"], "DATE": "2024-08-12T19:15:16", "CVSS": 7.1, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Firewalla BTLE Weak Credentials", "DESC": "A weak credential vulnerability exists in Firewalla Box Software versions before 1.979. This vulnerability allows a physically close attacker to use the license UUID for authentication and provision SSH credentials over the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface. Once an attacker gains access to the LAN, they could log into the SSH interface using the provisioned credentials. The license UUID can be acquired through plain-text Bluetooth sniffing, reading the QR code on the bottom of the device, or brute-forcing the UUID (though this is less likely).", "VENDOR": []}
