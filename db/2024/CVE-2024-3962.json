This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Successful exploitation requires the PPOM Pro plugin to be installed along with a WooCommerce product that contains a file upload field to retrieve the correct nonce.", "VENDOR": ["themeisle", "themeisle$PRODUCT$product_addons_\\&_fields_for_woocommerce"]}
