Messages sent using this script are vulnerable to abuse, as the script allows anybody to specify arbitrary email recipients and include user-provided content in confirmation emails.

There are no workarounds for this issue. Users must upgrade to version 1.0.0 to mitigate the vulnerability.", "VENDOR": []}
