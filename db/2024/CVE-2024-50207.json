This operation may be invoked concurrently with readers that\nrely on some of the modified data, such as the head bit (RB_PAGE_HEAD), or\nthe ring_buffer_per_cpu.pages and reader_page pointers. However, no\nexclusive access is acquired by ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set(). Modifying\nthe mentioned data while a reader also operates on them can then result in\nincorrect memory access and various crashes.\n\nFix the problem by taking the reader_lock when updating a specific\nring_buffer_per_cpu in ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set().", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
