This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.", "VENDOR": ["simple-membership-plugin", "simple-membership-plugin$PRODUCT$simple_membership"]}
