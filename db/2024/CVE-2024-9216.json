{"CVE": "CVE-2024-9216", "CWE": ["CWE-304"], "DATE": "2025-03-20T10:15:47", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Authentication Bypass in gaizhenbiao/ChuanhuChatGPT", "DESC": "An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in gaizhenbiao/ChuanhuChatGPT, as of commit 3856d4f, allowing any user to read and delete other users' chat history. The vulnerability arises because the username is provided via an HTTP request from the client side, rather than being read from a secure source like a cookie. This allows an attacker to pass another user's username to the get_model function, thereby gaining unauthorized access to that user's chat history.", "VENDOR": ["gaizhenbiao", "gaizhenbiao$PRODUCT$chuanhuchatgpt"]}
