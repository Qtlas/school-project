This vulnerability could potentially allow unauthorized read or write access to a Canister's memory. However, exploiting this bug requires the Canister to enable the incremental garbage collector or enhanced orthogonal persistence, which are non-default features in Motoko.", "VENDOR": ["dfinity", "dfinity$PRODUCT$motoko"]}
