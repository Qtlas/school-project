An attacker can exploit this by luring users into accessing a calendar event's notes, which triggers a logout request and terminates their session. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality, allowing malicious actions to be executed without user consent.", "VENDOR": ["vanderbilt", "vanderbilt$PRODUCT$redcap"]}
