An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of TCP packets to the Device Console UI. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the Device Console UI process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. A manual reload of the fabric interconnect is needed to restore complete functionality.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$imm_management_package", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_64108", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6454", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_6536"]}
