An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PPPoE packet to an affected line card interface that does not terminate PPPoE. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the ppp_ma process, resulting in a DoS condition for PPPoE traffic across the router.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9000v-v2", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9001", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9006", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9010", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9901", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9902", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9903", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9904", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9906", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9910", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9912", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9922", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr"]}
