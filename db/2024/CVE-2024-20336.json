In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap121", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap121_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap125", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap125_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap131", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap131_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap150", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap150_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap320", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap320_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap321", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap321_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap351", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap351_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap361", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap361_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap371", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap371_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap571", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap571_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap571e", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap571e_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap581", "cisco$PRODUCT$wap581_firmware"]}
