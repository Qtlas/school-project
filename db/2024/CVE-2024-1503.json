This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate the plugin and erase all data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This requires the \"Erase upon uninstallation\" option to be enabled.", "VENDOR": ["themeum", "themeum$PRODUCT$tutor_lms"]}
