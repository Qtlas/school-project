{"CVE": "CVE-2024-2494", "CWE": ["CWE-789"], "DATE": "2024-03-21T14:15:10", "CVSS": 6.2, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "TITLE": "Libvirt: negative g_new0 length can lead to unbounded memory allocation", "DESC": "A flaw was found in the RPC library APIs of libvirt. The RPC server deserialization code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negative length check is performed by the C API entry points. Passing a negative length to the g_new0 function results in a crash due to the negative length being treated as a huge positive number. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.", "VENDOR": []}
