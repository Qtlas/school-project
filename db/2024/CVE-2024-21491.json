An attacker can bypass signature verification by providing a shorter signature that matches the beginning of the actual signature.\r\r**Note:**\r\rThe attacker would need to know a victim uses the Rust library for verification,no easy way to automatically check that; and uses webhooks by a service that uses Svix, and then figure out a way to craft a malicious payload that will actually include all of the correct identifiers needed to trick the receivers to cause actual issues.", "PRODUIT": ["svix", "svix$PRODUCT$svix-webhooks"]}
