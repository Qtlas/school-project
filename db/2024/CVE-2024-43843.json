The allocated image will then be\npopulated with instructions during the real patch phase. But after\ncommit 26ef208c209a (\"bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size\"), the `im`\nargument is inconsistent in the dry run and real patch phase. This may\ncause emit_imm in RV64 to generate a different number of instructions\nwhen generating the 'im' address, potentially causing out-of-bounds\nissues. Let's emit the maximum number of instructions for the \"im\"\naddress during dry run to fix this problem.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
