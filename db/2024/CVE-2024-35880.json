Since we're inside mmap, we cannot safely use\nthe io_uring lock. Rely on the fact that we can lookup the buffer list\nunder RCU now and grab a reference to it, preventing it from being\nunregistered until we're done with it. The lookup returns the\nio_buffer_list directly with it referenced.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
