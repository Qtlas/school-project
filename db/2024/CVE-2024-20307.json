An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: Only traffic that is directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
