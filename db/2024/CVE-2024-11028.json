This is due to the user impersonation feature inappropriately determining the current user via user-supplied input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate an impersonation link that will allow them to log in as any existing user, such as an administrator. NOTE: The user impersonation feature was disabled in version 1.1.0 and re-enabled with a patch in version 1.1.2.", "VENDOR": ["icdsoft", "icdsoft$PRODUCT$multimanager_wp"]}
