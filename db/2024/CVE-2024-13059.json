This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.", "VENDOR": ["mintplexlabs", "mintplexlabs$PRODUCT$anythingllm"]}
