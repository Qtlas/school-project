Specifically, when the server utilizes Google KMS, untrusted data is passed to the `eval` function without any sanitization. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious values into environment variables through the `/config/update` endpoint, which allows for the update of settings in `proxy_server_config.yaml`.", "VENDOR": []}
