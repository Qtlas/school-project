In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid admin credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340w_dual_wan_gigabit_wireless-ac_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv340w_dual_wan_gigabit_wireless-ac_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345_dual_wan_gigabit_vpn_router_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345p_dual_wan_gigabit_poe_vpn_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv345p_dual_wan_gigabit_poe_vpn_router_firmware"]}
