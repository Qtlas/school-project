The default Content Security Policy of pretix prevents execution of attacker-provided scripts, making exploitation unlikely. However, combined with a CSP bypass (which is not currently known) the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other organizers or staff users.", "VENDOR": ["pretix", "pretix$PRODUCT$pretix"]}
