It drops the\nreference count from the platform device being probed.  If error path is\ntriggered, this will lead to unbalanced device reference counts and\npremature release of device resources, thus possible use-after-free when\nreleasing remaining devm-managed resources.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
