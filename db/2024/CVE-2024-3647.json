This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This requires the premium version of the plugin to be installed and activated in order to be exploited.", "PRODUIT": ["leap13", "leap13$PRODUCT$premium_addons_for_elementor"]}
