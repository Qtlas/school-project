A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory results in a NULL pointer. This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent crash of virtinterfaced. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only socket to crash the virtinterfaced daemon.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$libvirt"]}
