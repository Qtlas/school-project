This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "VENDOR": ["mijnpress", "mijnpress$PRODUCT$simple_add_pages_or_posts"]}
