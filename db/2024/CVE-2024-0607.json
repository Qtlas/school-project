{"CVE": "CVE-2024-0607", "CWE": ["CWE-229", "NVD-CWE-Other"], "DATE": "2024-01-18 16:15:08", "SCORE": 6.6, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "TITLE": "Kernel: nf_tables: pointer math issue in nft_byteorder_eval()", "DESC": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element corrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality.", "PRODUIT": "fedoraproject"}
