{"CVE": "CVE-2024-47821", "CWE": ["CWE-78"], "DATE": "2024-10-25T23:15:02.530000+00:00", "CVSS": 9.1, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "pyLoad vulnerable to remote code execution by download to /.pyload/scripts using /flashgot API", "DESC": "pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager. The folder `/.pyload/scripts` has scripts which are run when certain actions are completed, for e.g. a download is finished. By downloading a executable file to a folder in /scripts and performing the respective action, remote code execution can be achieved in versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev87. A file can be downloaded to such a folder by changing the download folder to a folder in `/scripts` path and using the `/flashgot` API to download the file. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to change the settings on a pyload server to execute arbitrary code and completely compromise the system. Version 0.5.0b3.dev87 fixes this issue.", "VENDOR": []}
