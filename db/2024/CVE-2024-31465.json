Starting in version 5.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.20, 15.5.4, and 15.9-rc-1, any user with edit right on any page can execute any code on the server by adding an object of type `XWiki.SearchSuggestSourceClass` to their user profile or any other page.

As a workaround, manually apply the patch to the document `XWiki.SearchSuggestSourceSheet`.", "VENDOR": ["xwiki", "xwiki$PRODUCT$xwiki"]}
