{"CVE": "CVE-2024-27932", "CWE": ["CWE-20", "NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2024-03-21 02:52:21", "SCORE": 4.6, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "TITLE": "Deno's improper suffix match testing for DENO_AUTH_TOKENS", "DESC": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.8.0 and prior to version 1.40.4, Deno improperly checks that an import specifier's hostname is equal to or a child of a token's hostname, which can cause tokens to be sent to servers they shouldn't be sent to. An auth token intended for `example[.]com` may be sent to `notexample[.]com`. Anyone who uses DENO_AUTH_TOKENS and imports potentially untrusted code is affected. Version 1.40.0 contains a patch for this issue", "PRODUIT": "deno"}
