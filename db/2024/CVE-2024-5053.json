This makes it possible for Form Managers with a Subscriber-level access and above to modify the Mailchimp API key used for integration. At the same time, missing Mailchimp API key validation allows the redirect of the integration requests to the attacker-controlled server.", "VENDOR": ["fluentforms", "fluentforms$PRODUCT$contact_form"]}
