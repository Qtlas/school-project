This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the UPDM_wemCmdCreatSHA256Hash function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.\n\nWas ZDI-CAN-23105", "VENDOR": ["alpsalpine", "alpsalpine$PRODUCT$ilx-f509", "alpsalpine$PRODUCT$ilx-f509_firmware"]}
