Even before the skb is transmitted, the\ntun_xdp_one-->eth_type_trans() may access the Ethernet header although it\ncan be less than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause\nout-of-bound access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer\nwith incorrect or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.\n\nIn the alternative path, tun_get_user() already prohibits short frame which\nhas the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted for\nIFF_TAP.\n\nThis is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like\nhow tun_get_user() does.\n\nCVE: CVE-2024-41091", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
