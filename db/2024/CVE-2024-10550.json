The endpoint applies a user-specified regular expression to a user-controllable string. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause inefficient regular expression complexity, leading to the exhaustion of server resources and making the server unresponsive.", "PRODUIT": ["h2o", "h2o$PRODUCT$h2o"]}
