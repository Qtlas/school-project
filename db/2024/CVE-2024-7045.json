The application does not verify whether the attacker is an administrator, allowing the attacker to directly call the /api/v1/prompts/ interface to retrieve all prompt information created by the admin, which includes the ID values. Subsequently, the attacker can exploit the /api/v1/prompts/command/{command_id} interface to obtain arbitrary prompt information.", "PRODUIT": ["openwebui", "openwebui$PRODUCT$open_webui"]}
