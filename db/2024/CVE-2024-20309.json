An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by reverse telnetting to the AUX port and sending specific data after connecting. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reset or stop responding, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
