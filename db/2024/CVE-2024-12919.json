This is due to the pms_pb_payment_redirect_link function using the user-controlled value supplied via the 'pms_payment_id' parameter to authenticate users without any further identity validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid payment ID to log in as any user who has made a purchase on the targeted site.", "VENDOR": ["cozmoslabs", "cozmoslabs$PRODUCT$membership_\\&_content_restriction_-_paid_member_subscriptions"]}
