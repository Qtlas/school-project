This is due to the plugin generating too weak OTP, and there\u2019s no attempt or time limit. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force the 6-digit numeric OTP that makes it possible to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.", "VENDOR": []}
