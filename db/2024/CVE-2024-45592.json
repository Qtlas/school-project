Prior to version 5.2.6, there is an unescaped entity property enabling Javascript injection. This is possible because `%source_label%` in twig macro is not escaped. Therefore script tags can be inserted and are executed. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.0.0 and 5.2.6.", "PRODUIT": ["damienharper", "damienharper$PRODUCT$auditor-bundle"]}
