A specifically crafted request allowed the creation of a special chart type with the ability to pass custom javascript code that would later be executed in an unprotected sandbox on subsequent requests to that chart. The problem was fixed in the datalens-ui version `0.1449.0`. Restricting access to the API for creating or modifying charts (`/charts/api/charts/v1/`) would mitigate the issue.", "PRODUIT": ""}
