This is due to missing nonce validation on the wpabstracts_load_status() and wpabstracts_delete_abstracts() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "PRODUIT": ["kevonadonis", "kevonadonis$PRODUCT$wp_abstracts"]}
