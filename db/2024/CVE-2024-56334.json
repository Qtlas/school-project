In affected versions SSIDs are not sanitized when before they are passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands.

This issue has been addressed in version 5.23.7 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": []}
