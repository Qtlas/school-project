Callers need to take care\nto handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional\nor security issues.\n\nLeak the decrypted memory when set_memory_decrypted() fails,\nand don't need to print an error since set_memory_decrypted()\nwill call WARN_ONCE().", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
