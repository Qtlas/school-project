NVMS-9000 firmware (used by many white-labeled DVR/NVR/IPC products) versions prior to 1.3.4 contain an authentication bypass in the NVMS-9000 control protocol. By sending a single crafted TCP payload to an exposed NVMS-9000 control port, an unauthenticated remote attacker can invoke privileged administrative query commands without valid credentials. Successful exploitation discloses sensitive information including administrator usernames and passwords in cleartext, network and service configuration, and other device details via commands such as queryBasicCfg, queryUserList, queryEmailCfg, queryPPPoECfg, and queryFTPCfg.", "VENDOR": []}
