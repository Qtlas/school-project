This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin dashboard access (contributors by default due to WooCommerce) to view arbitrary decrypted license keys. The functions contain a referrer nonce check. However, these can be retrieved via the dashboard through the \"license\" JS variable.", "VENDOR": ["wpexperts", "wpexperts$PRODUCT$license_manager_for_woocommerce"]}
