Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the telematics functionality. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.", "VENDOR": ["pioneer", "pioneer$PRODUCT$dmh-wt7600nex", "pioneer$PRODUCT$dmh-wt7600nex_firmware"]}
