This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what users a group leader can edit. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group leader-level access and above, to change admin account email addresses which can subsequently lead to admin account access.", "PRODUIT": ["uncannyowl", "uncannyowl$PRODUCT$uncanny_groups_for_learndash"]}
