This is due to the missing input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into form fields that get executed on the server during the export, potentially leading to a complete site compromise. \r\nAs a prerequisite, the custom export field should include fields containing user-supplied data.", "PRODUIT": ["soflyy", "soflyy$PRODUCT$wp_all_export"]}
