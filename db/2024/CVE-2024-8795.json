This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the my_account_update() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update a user's account details via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to reset a user's password and gain access to their account.", "PRODUIT": ["ba-booking", "ba-booking$PRODUCT$ba_book_everything"]}
