Therefore, the freeing must also be done\ndifferently, explicitly NULL'ing it out after the free, since\notherwise there's a nasty double-free bug here if a file fails\nto load after this has been parsed, and we get another free\nlater (e.g. because no other file exists.) Fix that by adding\nthe missing NULL assignment.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
