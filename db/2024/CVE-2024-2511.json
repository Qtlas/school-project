In this case, under certain conditions, the\nsession cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly\nas it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A\nmalicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to\nforce a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.\n\nThis issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS\nclients.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL\n1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.", "VENDOR": []}
