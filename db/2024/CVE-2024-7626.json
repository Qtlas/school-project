This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php.", "VENDOR": ["wpdelicious", "wpdelicious$PRODUCT$wp_delicious"]}
