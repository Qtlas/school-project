The vulnerability is due to improper handling of form-data with a large filename in the file upload request. By sending a payload with an excessively large filename, the server becomes overwhelmed and unresponsive, leading to unavailability for legitimate users. This issue can be exploited without authentication, making it highly scalable and increasing the risk of exploitation.", "PRODUIT": "automatic1111"}
