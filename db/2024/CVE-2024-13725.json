This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where PHP files can be uploaded and included. If register_argc_argv is enabled on the server and pearcmd.php is installed, this issue might lead to Remote Code Execution.", "PRODUIT": ["keap", "keap$PRODUCT$keap_official_opt_in_forms"]}
