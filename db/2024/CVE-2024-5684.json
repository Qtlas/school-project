However, an attacker will not have developer or admin rights. If the implementation of the JWT-library is wrongly configured to accept \"none\"-algorithms, the server will pass insecure JWT. A local, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the authentication mechanism.", "PRODUIT": ["vw", "vw$PRODUCT$id.charger_connect", "vw$PRODUCT$id.charger_connect_firmware", "vw$PRODUCT$id.charger_pro", "vw$PRODUCT$id.charger_pro_firmware"]}
