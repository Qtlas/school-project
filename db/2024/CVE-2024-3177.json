The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service account\u2019s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation are used together with containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated.", "VENDOR": []}
