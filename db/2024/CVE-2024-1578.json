Random characters being dropped from ID card numbers compromises the uniqueness of ID cards that can, therefore, result in a security issue if the users are using the \u2018ID card self-registration\u2019 function.", "VENDOR": ["rfideas", "rfideas$PRODUCT$micard_plus_ble", "rfideas$PRODUCT$micard_plus_ble_firmware", "rfideas$PRODUCT$micard_plus_ci", "rfideas$PRODUCT$micard_plus_ci_firmware"]}
