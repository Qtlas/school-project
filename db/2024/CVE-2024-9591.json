This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with editor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "VENDOR": ["aftabhusain", "aftabhusain$PRODUCT$category_and_taxonomy_image"]}
