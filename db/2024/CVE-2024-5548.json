{"CVE": "CVE-2024-5548", "CWE": ["CWE-22"], "DATE": "2024-06-27T18:15:20", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Directory Traversal in stitionai/devika", "DESC": "A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika repository, specifically within the /api/download-project endpoint. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'project_name' parameter in a GET request to download arbitrary files from the system. This issue affects the latest version of the repository. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation in the 'download_project' function, allowing attackers to traverse the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.", "VENDOR": ["stitionai", "stitionai$PRODUCT$devika"]}
