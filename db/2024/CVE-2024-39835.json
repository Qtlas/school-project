The vulnerability arises from the use of the eval() method to process user-supplied, unsanitized parameter values within the substitution args mechanism, which roslaunch evaluates before launching a node. This flaw allows attackers to craft and execute arbitrary Python code.", "PRODUIT": ["openrobotics", "openrobotics$PRODUCT$robot_operating_system"]}
