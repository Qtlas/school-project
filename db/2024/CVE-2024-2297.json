This is due to insufficient validation checks placed on the create_autosave AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code with elevated (administrator-level) privileges. NOTE: Successful exploitation requires (1) the Bricks Builder to be enabled for posts (2) Builder access to be enabled for contributor-level users, and (3) \"Code Execution\" to be enabled for administrator-level users within the theme's settings.", "VENDOR": ["bricksbuilder", "bricksbuilder$PRODUCT$bricks"]}
