The /rptsvr/upload endpoint fails to sanitize the filename parameter in multipart form-data requests, enabling path traversal. This allows attackers to place executable files in web-accessible directories, potentially leading to remote code execution.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-08-23 UTC.", "VENDOR": []}
