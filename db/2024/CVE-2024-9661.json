This is due to missing nonce validation on the delete_and_edit function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete imported content (posts, comments, users, etc.) via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": []}
