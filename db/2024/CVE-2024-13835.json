This is due to the plugin not properly verifying the existence of a multisite installation prior to allowing user meta to be added/modified. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to gain elevated privileges on subsites that would otherwise be inaccessible.", "VENDOR": ["wpexpertplugins", "wpexpertplugins$PRODUCT$post_meta_data_manager"]}
