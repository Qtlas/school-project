The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the 'set' and 'get' verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code.", "VENDOR": ["openrobotics", "openrobotics$PRODUCT$robot_operating_system"]}
