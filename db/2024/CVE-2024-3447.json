The bug is triggered when both `s->data_count` and the size of  `s->fifo_buffer` are set to 0x200, leading to an out-of-bound access. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.", "PRODUIT": ["netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci_compute_node", "qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu"]}
