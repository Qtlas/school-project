The session IDs are \npredictable, with only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows \nattackers to pre-generate valid session IDs, leading to unauthorized \naccess to user sessions. This is not only due to the use of an \n(insecure) rand() function call but also because of missing \ninitialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively \nused as seed.", "VENDOR": ["rittal", "rittal$PRODUCT$cmc_iii_processing_units", "rittal$PRODUCT$cmc_iii_processing_units_firmware", "rittal$PRODUCT$iot_interface", "rittal$PRODUCT$iot_interface_firmware"]}
