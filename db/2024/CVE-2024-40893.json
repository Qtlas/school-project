A physically close \nattacker that is authenticated to the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BTLE) interface can use the network configuration service to inject commands in various configuration parameters including\u00a0networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.PingTestIP,\u00a0networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Extra.DNSTestDomain, and\u00a0networkConfig.Interface.Phy.Eth0.Gateway6. Additionally, because the configuration can be synced to the Firewalla cloud, the attacker may be able to persist access even after hardware resets and firmware re-flashes.", "VENDOR": []}
