This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'bmw_display_pv_set_page' function and insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'product_points' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "PRODUIT": ""}
