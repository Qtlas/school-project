When enabling the RSS feature on the virtio-net network card, the indirections_table data within RSS becomes controllable. Setting excessively large values may cause an index out-of-bounds issue, potentially resulting in heap overflow access. This flaw allows a privileged user in the guest to crash the QEMU process on the host.", "VENDOR": ["qemu", "qemu$PRODUCT$qemu", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
