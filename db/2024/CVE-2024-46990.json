When relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter a user may bypass this block by using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`). This issue has been addressed in release versions 10.13.3 and 11.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`.", "PRODUIT": ["monospace", "monospace$PRODUCT$directus"]}
