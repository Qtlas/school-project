Callers need to\ntake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security\nissues.\n\nThe netvsc driver could free decrypted/shared pages if\nset_memory_decrypted() fails. Check the decrypted field in the gpadl\nto decide whether to free the memory.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
