When the auth_type is use_3scale_oidc_issuer_endpoint, the Token Introspection policy discovers the Token Introspection endpoint from the token_introspection_endpoint field, but the field was removed on RH-SSO 7.5. As a result, the policy doesn't inspect tokens, it determines that all tokens are valid.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$3scale", "redhat$PRODUCT$keycloak"]}
