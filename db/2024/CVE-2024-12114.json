This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with granted access and above, to update arbitrary post and page content. This requires the Gallery Creator Role setting to be a value lower than 'Editor' for there to be any real impact.", "VENDOR": ["fooplugins", "fooplugins$PRODUCT$foogallery"]}
