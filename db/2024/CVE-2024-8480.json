This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to exploit the 'sirv_upload_file_by_chunks_callback' function, which lacks proper file type validation, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "VENDOR": ["sirv", "sirv$PRODUCT$sirv"]}
