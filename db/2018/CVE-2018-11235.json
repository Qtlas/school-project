With a crafted .gitmodules file, a malicious project can execute an arbitrary script on a machine that runs \"git clone --recurse-submodules\" because submodule \"names\" are obtained from this file, and then appended to $GIT_DIR/modules, leading to directory traversal with \"../\" in a name. Finally, post-checkout hooks from a submodule are executed, bypassing the intended design in which hooks are not obtained from a remote server.", "PRODUIT": "canonical"}
