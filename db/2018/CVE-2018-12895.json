This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "wordpress", "wordpress$PRODUCT$wordpress"]}
