{"CVE": "CVE-2018-7169", "CWE": ["CWE-732"], "DATE": "2018-02-15T20:29:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \"group blacklisting\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.", "VENDOR": ["shadow_project", "shadow_project$PRODUCT$shadow"]}
