The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data that is written to log files and displayed in certain web pages of the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link or view an affected log file. The injected script code may be executed in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$identity_services_engine_software"]}
