An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. The strcpy call overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"region\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["samsung", "samsung$PRODUCT$sth-eth-250", "samsung$PRODUCT$sth-eth-250_firmware"]}
