Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). The attacker can cause an arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "golang", "golang$PRODUCT$go", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$backports_sle", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap", "suse", "suse$PRODUCT$linux_enterprise_server"]}
