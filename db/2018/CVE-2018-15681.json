When a user logs in, their password hash is rehashed using a predictable salt and stored in the \"pass\" cookie, which is not flagged as HTTPOnly. Due to the weak and predictable salt that is in place, an attacker who successfully steals this cookie can efficiently brute-force it to retrieve the user's cleartext password.", "VENDOR": ["btiteam", "btiteam$PRODUCT$xbtit"]}
