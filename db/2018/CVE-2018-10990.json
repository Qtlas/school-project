NOTE: there is no documentation stating that the web UI's logout feature was supposed to do anything beyond removing the cookie from one instance of a web browser; a client-side logout action is often not intended to address cases where a person has made a copy of a cookie outside of a browser.", "VENDOR": ["commscope", "commscope$PRODUCT$arris_tg1682g", "commscope$PRODUCT$arris_tg1682g_firmware"]}
