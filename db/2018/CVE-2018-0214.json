These commands should have been restricted from this user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of CLI command user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a CLI command with crafted user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system that should be restricted. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials for the device.
