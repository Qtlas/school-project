An attacker can maliciously craft a fat binary containing multiple architectures that may cause a situation where Little Snitch treats the running process as having no code signature at all while erroneously indicating that the binary on disk does have a valid code signature. This could lead to users being confused about whether or not the code signature is valid.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "objective_development", "objective_development$PRODUCT$little_snitch"]}
