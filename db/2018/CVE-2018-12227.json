When endpoint specific ACL rules block a SIP request, they respond with a 403 forbidden. However, if an endpoint is not identified, then a 401 unauthorized response is sent. This vulnerability just discloses which requests hit a defined endpoint. The ACL rules cannot be bypassed to gain access to the disclosed endpoints.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "digium", "digium$PRODUCT$asterisk", "digium$PRODUCT$certified_asterisk"]}
