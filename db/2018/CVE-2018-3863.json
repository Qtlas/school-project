An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 40 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"user\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["samsung", "samsung$PRODUCT$sth-eth-250", "samsung$PRODUCT$sth-eth-250_firmware"]}
