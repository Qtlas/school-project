This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists when rendering U3D images inside of pdf files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of the current process.", "PRODUIT": ["foxitsoftware", "foxitsoftware$PRODUCT$phantompdf", "foxitsoftware$PRODUCT$reader"]}
