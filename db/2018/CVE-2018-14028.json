{"CVE": "CVE-2018-14028", "CWE": ["CWE-434"], "DATE": "2018-08-10 16:29:00", "SCORE": 6.5, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.", "PRODUIT": ["wordpress", "wordpress$PRODUCT$wordpress"]}
