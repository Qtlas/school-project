This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.5, Firefox ESR < 60.5, and Firefox < 65.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "mozilla", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox", "mozilla$PRODUCT$thunderbird", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_desktop", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_server", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_server_aus", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_server_eus", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_server_tus", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_workstation"]}
