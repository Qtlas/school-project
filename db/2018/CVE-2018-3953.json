Data entered into the 'Router Name' input field through the web portal is submitted to apply.cgi as the value to the 'machine_name' POST parameter. When the 'preinit' binary receives the SIGHUP signal, it enters a code path that continues until it reaches offset 0x0042B5C4 in the 'start_lltd' function. Within the 'start_lltd' function, a 'nvram_get' call is used to obtain the value of the user-controlled 'machine_name' NVRAM entry. This value is then entered directly into a command intended to write the host name to a file and subsequently executed.", "VENDOR": ["linksys", "linksys$PRODUCT$e1200", "linksys$PRODUCT$e1200_firmware", "linksys$PRODUCT$e2500", "linksys$PRODUCT$e2500_firmware"]}
