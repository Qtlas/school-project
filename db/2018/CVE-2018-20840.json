{"CVE": "CVE-2018-20840", "CWE": ["CWE-754"], "DATE": "2019-05-30T16:29:01.323000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "An unhandled exception vulnerability exists during Google Sign-In with Google API C++ Client before 2019-04-10. It potentially causes an outage of third-party services that were not designed to recover from exceptions. On the client, ID token handling can cause an unhandled exception because of misinterpretation of an integer as a string, resulting in denial-of-service and then other users can no longer login/sign-in to the affected third-party service. Once this third-party service uses Google Sign-In with google-api-cpp-client, a malicious user can trigger this client/auth/oauth2_authorization.cc vulnerability by requesting the client to receive the ID token from a Google authentication server.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$api_c\\+\\+_client"]}
