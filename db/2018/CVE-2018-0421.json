The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of incoming TCP SYN packets to specific listening ports. The improper handling of the TCP SYN packets could cause a system file description to be allocated and not freed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of TCP SYN packets to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to eventually restart if a file description cannot be obtained.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$prime_access_registrar", "cisco$PRODUCT$prime_access_registrar_jumpstart"]}
