The SSL/TLS server certificate in the device to cloud communication was not verified by the device. As a result, an attacker in control of the network traffic of a device could have taken control of a device by intercepting and modifying commands issued from the server to the device in a Man-in-the-Middle attack. This included the ability to inject firmware update commands into the communication and cause the device to install maliciously modified firmware.", "VENDOR": ["mystrom", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_bulb", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_bulb_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button_plus", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button_plus_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_led_strip", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_led_strip_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch_eu", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch_eu_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch_firmware"]}
