The vulnerability is due to the system not strictly filtering the file upload type. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to upload a script Trojan to admin.php/admin/configset/index/group/upload.html to gain server control by composing a request for a .txt upload and then changing it to a .php upload. The attacker must have admin access to change the upload_file_ext (aka \"Allow upload file suffix\") setting, and must use \"php,php\" in this setting to bypass the \"php\" restriction.", "VENDOR": ["ukcms", "ukcms$PRODUCT$ukcms"]}
