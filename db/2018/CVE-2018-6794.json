If a malicious server breaks a normal TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete, then the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for the HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets will inspect such network traffic as usual.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "suricata-ids", "suricata-ids$PRODUCT$suricata"]}
