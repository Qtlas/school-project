An attacker with network access to the device could send specially crafted network packets to determine whether or not a network port on another remote system is accessible or not. This allows the attacker to do basic network scanning using the victims machine. Successful exploitation requires a network connection to the affected device. The attacker does not need privileges, no user interaction is required. The impact is limited to determining whether or not a port on a target system is accessible by the affected device.", "PRODUIT": ["siemens", "siemens$PRODUCT$automation_license_manager"]}
