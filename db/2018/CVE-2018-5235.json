Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application.", "VENDOR": ["symantec", "symantec$PRODUCT$norton_utilities"]}
