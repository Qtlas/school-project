Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation through fake X.509 certificates. This is an even more permissive variant of CVE-2006-4790 and CVE-2014-1568.", "PRODUIT": ["axtls_project", "axtls_project$PRODUCT$axtls"]}
