The vulnerability is due to improper security restrictions that are imposed by the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting an empty password value to an affected device's BIOS authentication prompt. An exploit could allow the attacker to have access to a restricted set of user-level BIOS commands.
