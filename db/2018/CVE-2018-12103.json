Due to the predictability of the /docs/captcha_(number).jpeg URI, being local to the network, but unauthenticated to the administrator's panel, an attacker can disclose the CAPTCHAs used by the access point and can elect to load the CAPTCHA of their choosing, leading to unauthorized login attempts to the access point.", "VENDOR": ["d-link", "d-link$PRODUCT$dir-885\\/r", "d-link$PRODUCT$dir-885l\\/r_firmware", "d-link$PRODUCT$dir-895\\/r", "d-link$PRODUCT$dir-895l\\/r_firmware", "dlink", "dlink$PRODUCT$dir-890l", "dlink$PRODUCT$dir-890l_firmware"]}
