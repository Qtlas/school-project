This attack can be exploited by crafting a three backtick wrapped payload with a character in front: L: \"```<script>alert();</script>```\". NOTE: This has been argued as a non-issue (see references) since it is not the parser's job to sanitize malicious code from a parsed document", "VENDOR": ["cebe", "cebe$PRODUCT$markdown"]}
