When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub module stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of the request. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed, despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers were present, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "digium", "digium$PRODUCT$asterisk", "digium$PRODUCT$certified_asterisk"]}
