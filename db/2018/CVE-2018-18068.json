With a debug host processor A running in non-secure EL1 and a debug target processor B running in any privilege level, the debugging feature allows A to halt B and promote B to any privilege level. As a debug host, A has full control of B even if B owns a higher privilege level than A. Accordingly, A can read/write any EL3 memory/register via B. Also, with this memory access, A can execute arbitrary code in EL3.", "VENDOR": ["raspberrypi", "raspberrypi$PRODUCT$raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+", "raspberrypi$PRODUCT$raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware"]}
