This only affects certificates issued to the same domain as the host, so to impersonate a host one must already have a wildcard certificate matching other hosts in the same domain. For example, b*.example.com would match some hostnames that do not begin with a 'b' character.", "PRODUIT": ["botan_project", "botan_project$PRODUCT$botan"]}
