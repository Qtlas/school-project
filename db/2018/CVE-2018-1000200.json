{"CVE": "CVE-2018-1000200", "CWE": ["CWE-476"], "DATE": "2018-06-05T13:29:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
