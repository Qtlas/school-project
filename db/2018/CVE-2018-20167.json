{"CVE": "CVE-2018-20167", "CWE": ["CWE-74"], "DATE": "2018-12-17T05:29:00.957000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "Terminology before 1.3.1 allows Remote Code Execution because popmedia is mishandled, as demonstrated by an unsafe \"cat README.md\" command when \\e}pn is used. A popmedia control sequence can allow the malicious execution of executable file formats registered in the X desktop share MIME types (/usr/share/applications). The control sequence defers unknown file types to the handle_unknown_media() function, which executes xdg-open against the filename specified in the sequence. The use of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME type to be executed. An attacker can achieve remote code execution by introducing an executable file and a plain text file containing the control sequence through a fake software project (e.g., in Git or a tarball). When the control sequence is rendered (such as with cat), the executable file will be run.", "VENDOR": ["enlightenment", "enlightenment$PRODUCT$terminology"]}
