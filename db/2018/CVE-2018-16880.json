A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, can trigger an out-of-bounds write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may lead to a kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. Versions from v4.16 and newer are vulnerable.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
