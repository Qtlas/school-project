They have made modifications that allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell via ADB. Modifying the read-only properties by an app as the system user creates a UNIX domain socket named factory_test that will execute commands as the root user by processes that have privilege to access it (as per the SELinux rules that the vendor controls).", "VENDOR": ["alcatel", "alcatel$PRODUCT$a30", "alcatel$PRODUCT$a30_firmware"]}
