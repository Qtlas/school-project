An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$etcd"]}
