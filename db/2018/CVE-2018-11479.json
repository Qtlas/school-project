Also, it creates a WindScribeService.exe system process that establishes a \\\\.\\pipe\\WindscribeService named pipe endpoint that allows the Windscribe VPN process to connect and execute an OpenVPN process or other processes (like taskkill, etc.). There is no validation of the program name before constructing the lpCommandLine argument for a CreateProcess call. An attacker can run any malicious process with SYSTEM privileges through this named pipe.", "VENDOR": ["windscribe", "windscribe$PRODUCT$windscribe"]}
