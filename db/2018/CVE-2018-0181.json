The vulnerability is due to improper authentication when accessing the Redis server. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying key-value pairs stored within the Redis server database. An exploit could allow the attacker to reduce the efficiency of the Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$cisco_policy_suite_diameter_routing_agent", "cisco$PRODUCT$cisco_policy_suite_for_mobile"]}
