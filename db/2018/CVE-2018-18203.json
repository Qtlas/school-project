This occurs because the device accepts modified QNX6 filesystem images (as long as the attacker obtains access to certain Harman decryption/encryption code) as a consequence of a bug where unsigned images pass a validity check. An attacker could potentially install persistent malicious head unit firmware and execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "VENDOR": ["subaru", "subaru$PRODUCT$starlink_2017", "subaru$PRODUCT$starlink_2017_firmware", "subaru$PRODUCT$starlink_2018", "subaru$PRODUCT$starlink_2018_firmware", "subaru$PRODUCT$starlink_2019", "subaru$PRODUCT$starlink_2019_firmware"]}
