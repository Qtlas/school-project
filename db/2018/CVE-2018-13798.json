Specially crafted network packets sent to port 80/TCP or 443/TCP could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the web server. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems on port 80/TCP or 443/TCP. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the web server. A system reboot is required to recover the web service of the device. At the time of advisory update, exploit code for this security vulnerability is public.", "VENDOR": ["siemens", "siemens$PRODUCT$sicam_a8000_cp-8000", "siemens$PRODUCT$sicam_a8000_cp-8000_firmware", "siemens$PRODUCT$sicam_a8000_cp-802x", "siemens$PRODUCT$sicam_a8000_cp-802x_firmware", "siemens$PRODUCT$sicam_a8000_cp-8050", "siemens$PRODUCT$sicam_a8000_cp-8050_firmware"]}
