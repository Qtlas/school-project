The core components that create and launch a print job do not perform complete verification of the session cookie that is supplied to them. As a result, an attacker with guest/pseudo-guest level permissions can bypass the session checks (that would otherwise logout a low-privileged user) by calling the core print job components directly via crafted HTTP GET and POST requests.", "PRODUIT": ["printeron", "printeron$PRODUCT$central_print_services"]}
