The web maintenance script posts to the internal goForm endpoint '/goform/Mail_Test' and uses several form parameters directly in a call to a system email utility without proper input validation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can supply crafted form data that injects shell commands, resulting in execution as root on the device.
