It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.", "VENDOR": ["postgresql", "postgresql$PRODUCT$postgresql_jdbc_driver", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
