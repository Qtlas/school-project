When closing and cleaning up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.", "PRODUIT": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$curl"]}
