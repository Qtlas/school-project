{"CVE": "CVE-2018-12633", "CWE": ["CWE-362"], "DATE": "2018-06-22T00:29:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. vbg_misc_device_ioctl() in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads the same user data twice with copy_from_user. The header part of the user data is double-fetched, and a malicious user thread can tamper with the critical variables (hdr.size_in and hdr.size_out) in the header between the two fetches because of a race condition, leading to severe kernel errors, such as buffer over-accesses. This bug can cause a local denial of service and information leakage.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
