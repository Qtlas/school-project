The issue was caused by attempting to process an unbounded number of pending VLAN authentication requests, leading to excessive memory allocation. This issue only affects devices configured for DHCPv4/v6 over AE auto-sensed VLANs, utilized in Broadband Edge (BBE) deployments. Other configurations are unaffected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R6-S2, 15.1R7; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R5-S1, 16.1R6; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S2, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S5, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R2.", "PRODUIT": ["juniper", "juniper$PRODUCT$junos"]}
