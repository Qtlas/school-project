In this contract, 'bool sufficientAllowance = allowance <= _value' will cause an arbitrary transfer in the function transferFrom because '<=' is used instead of '>=' (which was intended). An attacker can transfer from any address to his address, and does not need to meet the 'allowance > value' condition.", "VENDOR": ["virgo_zodiactoken_project", "virgo_zodiactoken_project$PRODUCT$virgo_zodiactoken"]}
