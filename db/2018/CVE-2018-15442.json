An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges. While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_meetings_desktop", "cisco$PRODUCT$webex_productivity_tools"]}
