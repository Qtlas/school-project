{"CVE": "CVE-2018-10906", "CWE": ["CWE-269", "CWE-285"], "DATE": "2018-07-24 20:29:00", "SCORE": 4.6, "METRIC": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.", "PRODUIT": "debian"}
