By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where the constant DWORD 0 will be written to a user-controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to zero-out the pointer to the security descriptor in the object header of a privileged process or modify the security descriptor itself and run code in the context of a process running as SYSTEM.", "VENDOR": ["sophos", "sophos$PRODUCT$safeguard_easy_device_encryption_client", "sophos$PRODUCT$safeguard_enterprise_client", "sophos$PRODUCT$safeguard_lan_crypt_client"]}
