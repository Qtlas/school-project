The cloud API had a hidden parameter, which allowed an authenticated user to reconfigure the server URL for a device registered to their account. In combination with an insecure device registration vulnerability, this allowed an attacker to reconfigure a maliciously registered device to their own rogue replica of the myStrom API and issue commands to the device, including firmware update commands.", "VENDOR": ["mystrom", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_bulb", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_bulb_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button_plus", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_button_plus_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_led_strip", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_led_strip_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch_eu", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch_eu_firmware", "mystrom$PRODUCT$wifi_switch_firmware"]}
