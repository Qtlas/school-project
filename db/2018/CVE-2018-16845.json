The issue only affects nginx if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module (the module is not built by default) and the .mp4. directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the attack is only possible if an attacker is able to trigger processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the ngx_http_mp4_module.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$xcode", "canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "f5", "f5$PRODUCT$nginx", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$leap"]}
