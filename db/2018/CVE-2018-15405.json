An attacker who has valid application credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information that belongs to other users. The attacker could then use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ucs_director"]}
