This improper handling might be exploited for arbitrary code execution via a malicious gcc plugin, if an attacker has write access to a directory that is a parent of the base directory of the project being checked. NOTE: exploitation is more difficult after 3.8.0 because filename prediction may be needed.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "syntastic_project", "syntastic_project$PRODUCT$syntastic"]}
