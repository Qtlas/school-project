{"CVE": "CVE-2018-0270", "CWE": ["CWE-352"], "DATE": "2018-05-17 03:29:00", "SCORE": 6.8, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and alter the data of existing users and groups on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could create a new, privileged account to obtain full control over the device interface. This vulnerability affects Connected Grid Network Management System, if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 3.0; and IoT Field Network Director, if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.1.1-6 or 4.2.0-123.
