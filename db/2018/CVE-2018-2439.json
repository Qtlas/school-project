Several areas of the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) did not require sufficient input validation. Namely, the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) HTTP and RFC listener, SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) portwatcher when registering a portwatcher to the multiplexer and the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) multiplexer had insufficient input validation and thus allowing a malformed data packet to cause a crash.", "VENDOR": ["sap", "sap$PRODUCT$internet_graphics_server"]}
