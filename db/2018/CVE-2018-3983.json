A specially crafted document can cause an array fetch to return an uninitialized pointer and then performs some arithmetic before writing a value to the result. Usage of this uninitialized pointer can allow an attacker to corrupt heap memory resulting in code execution under the context of the application. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["atlantiswordprocessor", "atlantiswordprocessor$PRODUCT$atlantis_word_processor"]}
