When configured to accept smart-card authentication, Samba's KDC will call talloc_free() twice on the same memory if the principal in a validly signed certificate does not match the principal in the AS-REQ. This is only possible after authentication with a trusted certificate. talloc is robust against further corruption from a double-free with talloc_free() and directly calls abort(), terminating the KDC process.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "samba", "samba$PRODUCT$samba"]}
