The affected vacuum cleaner suffers from an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability. An authenticated attacker can send a specially crafted UDP packet, and execute commands on the vacuum cleaner as root. The bug is in the function REQUEST_SET_WIFIPASSWD (UDP command 153). A crafted UDP packet runs \"/mnt/skyeye/mode_switch.sh %s\" with an attacker controlling the %s variable. In some cases, authentication can be achieved with the default password of 888888 for the admin account.", "VENDOR": ["diqee", "diqee$PRODUCT$diqee360", "diqee$PRODUCT$diqee360_firmware"]}
