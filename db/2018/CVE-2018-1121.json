{"CVE": "CVE-2018-1121", "CWE": ["CWE-362", "CWE-367"], "DATE": "2018-06-13 20:29:00", "SCORE": 4.3, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "procps-ng, procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition. Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.", "PRODUIT": "procps_project"}
