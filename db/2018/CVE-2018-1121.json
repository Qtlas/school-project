{"CVE": "CVE-2018-1121", "CWE": ["CWE-362", "CWE-367"], "DATE": "2018-06-13T20:29:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "procps-ng, procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition. Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.", "VENDOR": ["procps_project", "procps_project$PRODUCT$procps"]}
