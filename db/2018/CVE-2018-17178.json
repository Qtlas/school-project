They execute unauthenticated manual drive commands (sent to /bin/webserver on port 8081) if they already have an active session. Commands like forward, back, arc-left, arc-right, pivot-left, and pivot-right are executed even though the web socket replies with { \"message\" : \"invalid authorization header\" }. Without an active session, commands are still interpreted, but (except for eco-on and eco-off) have no effect, since without active driving, a driving direction does not change anything.", "VENDOR": ["neatorobotics", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d3_connected", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d3_connected_firmware", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d4_connected", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d4_connected_firmware", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d5_connected", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d5_connected_firmware", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d6_connected", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d6_connected_firmware", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d7_connected", "neatorobotics$PRODUCT$botvac_d7_connected_firmware"]}
