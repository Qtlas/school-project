{"CVE": "CVE-2018-6857", "CWE": ["CWE-119"], "DATE": "2018-07-09T18:29:01", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise before 8.00.5, SafeGuard Easy before 7.00.3, and SafeGuard LAN Crypt before 3.95.2 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x802022E0. By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where the constant 0x12 will be written to a user-controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to modify the SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure of the Token object belonging to the exploit process and grant SE_DEBUG_NAME privilege. This allows the exploit process to interact with higher privileged processes running as SYSTEM and execute code in their security context.", "VENDOR": ["sophos", "sophos$PRODUCT$safeguard_easy_device_encryption_client", "sophos$PRODUCT$safeguard_enterprise_client", "sophos$PRODUCT$safeguard_lan_crypt_client"]}
