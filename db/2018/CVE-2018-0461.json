The vulnerability exists because the software running on an affected device insufficiently validates user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link provided to the user or through the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the user interface or access sensitive system-based information, which under normal circumstances should be prohibited.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8800_series_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8811", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8841", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8845", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8851", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8861", "cisco$PRODUCT$ip_phone_8865"]}
