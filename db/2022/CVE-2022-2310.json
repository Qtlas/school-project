This is possible because of SWG incorrectly whitelisting authentication bypass methods and using a weak crypto password. This can lead to the attacker logging into the SWG admin interface, without valid credentials, as the super user with complete control over the SWG.", "VENDOR": ["skyhighsecurity", "skyhighsecurity$PRODUCT$secure_web_gateway"]}
