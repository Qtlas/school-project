This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of an ingress TCP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP data to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the checkpoint manager process restarting.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$redundancy_configuration_manager"]}
