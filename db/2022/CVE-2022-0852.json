The specific impact varies upon the privileges of the Red Hat account in question, but it could affect the integrity, availability, and/or data confidentiality of other systems that are administered by that account. This occurs regardless of how the password is supplied to convert2rhel.", "VENDOR": ["convert2rhel_project", "convert2rhel_project$PRODUCT$convert2rhel", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
