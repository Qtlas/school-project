Only\nieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. In the Tx case we then leak\nthe skb structure.\n\nFree the skb structure upon error before returning when appropriate.\n\nAs the 'is_tx = 0' cannot be moved in the complete handler because of a\npossible race between the delay in switching to STATE_RX_AACK_ON and a\nnew interrupt, we introduce an intermediate 'was_tx' boolean just for\nthis purpose.\n\nThere is no Fixes tag applying here, many changes have been made on this\narea and the issue kind of always existed.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
