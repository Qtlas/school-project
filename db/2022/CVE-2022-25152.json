It is possible to require a mandatory approval process. Due to a vulnerability in the approval process, present in any version prior to 6.35.37347.20040, a malicious actor (with a valid session token) can create a procedure, bypass approval, and execute the procedure. This results in the ability for any user with a valid session token to perform arbitrary code execution and full system take-over on all agents.", "PRODUIT": ["itarian", "itarian$PRODUCT$on-premise", "itarian$PRODUCT$saas_service_desk"]}
