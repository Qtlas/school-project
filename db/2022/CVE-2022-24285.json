In addition, the service program does not verify the user when communicating. A thread may exist with a specific command. When the path of the program to be executed is sent, there is a local privilege escalation in which the service program executes the path with system privileges.", "VENDOR": ["acer", "acer$PRODUCT$care_center"]}
