NOTE: the vendor believes it would be unrealistic for an application to call NmapProcess with arguments taken from input data that arrived over an untrusted network, and thus the CVSS score corresponds to an unrealistic use case. None of the NmapProcess documentation implies that this is an expected use case", "VENDOR": ["python-libnmap_project", "python-libnmap_project$PRODUCT$python-libnmap"]}
