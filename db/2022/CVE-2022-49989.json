This could result in sporadic failures\nwhen using the related memory in user mode.\n\nFix all of that by calling unlock_pages() always with the real number\nof pinned pages, which will be zero in case pages being NULL, and by\nchecking the number of pages pinned by pin_user_pages_fast() matching\nthe expected number of pages.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
