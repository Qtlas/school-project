This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$curl", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$clustered_data_ontap", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h300s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h410s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h500s_firmware", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s", "netapp$PRODUCT$h700s_firmware", "splunk", "splunk$PRODUCT$universal_forwarder"]}
