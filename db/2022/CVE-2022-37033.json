In resolving this URL, the TempFileAPI follows any 302 redirects that the remote URL returns. Because there is no re-validation of the redirect URL, the TempFileAPI can be used to return data from those local/private hosts that should not be accessible remotely.", "PRODUIT": ["dotcms", "dotcms$PRODUCT$dotcms"]}
