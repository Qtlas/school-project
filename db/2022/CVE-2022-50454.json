On failures, ttm will call nouveau_bo_del_ttm() and\nfree the memory.Thus, when nouveau_bo_init() returns an error, the gem\nobject has already been released. Then the call to nouveau_bo_ref() will\nuse the freed \"nvbo->bo\" and lead to a use-after-free bug.\n\nWe should delete the call to nouveau_bo_ref() to avoid the use-after-free.", "PRODUIT": ""}
