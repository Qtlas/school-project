The device-mapper-multipath allows local users to obtain root access, exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users that are able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This issue occurs because an attacker can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled when arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR. This could lead to local privilege escalation to root.", "PRODUIT": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$device-mapper-multipath", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
