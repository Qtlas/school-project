This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain TCP segments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted TCP traffic at a high rate through an interface of an affected device. That interface would need to have AppNav interception enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-4g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1100-6g_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1101_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1109_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$111x_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1120_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1131_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$1160_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4221_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4331_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4431_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$4461_integrated_services_router", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1001-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_1002-x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8000v_edge", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-1n1s-4t2x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-1n1s-6t", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-2n2s-4t2x", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8300-2n2s-6t", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8500", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8500-4qc", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_8500l", "cisco$PRODUCT$cloud_services_router_1000v", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xe"]}
