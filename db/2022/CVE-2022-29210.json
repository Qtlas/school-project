{"CVE": "CVE-2022-29210", "CWE": ["CWE-120", "CWE-122", "CWE-787"], "DATE": "2022-05-21 00:15:11", "SCORE": 5.5, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "TITLE": "Heap buffer overflow due to incorrect hash function in TensorFlow", "DESC": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1.", "PRODUIT": "google"}
