An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by ensuring that the device will connect to an SSL/TLS server that is using specific encryption parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_services_software_for_asa", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
