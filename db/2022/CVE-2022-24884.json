A signature consisting only of zeroes is always considered valid, making it trivial to forge signatures. Requiring multiple signatures from different public keys does not mitigate the issue: `ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of such forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the libecdsautil library are affected. The issue has been fixed in ecdsautils 0.4.1. All older versions of ecdsautils (including versions before the split into a library and a CLI utility) are vulnerable.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "ecdsautils_project", "ecdsautils_project$PRODUCT$ecdsautils", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora"]}
