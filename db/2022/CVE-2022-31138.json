Users should update their mailcow instances with the `update.sh` script in the mailcow root directory to 2022-06a or newer to receive a patch for this issue. As a temporary workaround, the Syncjob ACL can be removed from all mailbox users, preventing changes to those settings.", "PRODUIT": ["mailcow", "mailcow$PRODUCT$mailcow\\"]}
