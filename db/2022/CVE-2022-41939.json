This issues has been patched in PR #1442, and is part of release 1.8.1. This issue only affects users who are using function buildpacks from third-parties; pinning the builder image to a specific content-hash with a valid `lifecycle` image will also mitigate the attack.", "PRODUIT": "linuxfoundation"}
