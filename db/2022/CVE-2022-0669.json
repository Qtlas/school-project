This flaw allows a malicious vhost-user master to attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master exhausts available fd in the vhost-user slave process, leading to a denial of service.", "VENDOR": ["dpdk", "dpdk$PRODUCT$data_plane_development_kit", "openvswitch", "openvswitch$PRODUCT$openvswitch", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform"]}
