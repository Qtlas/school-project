After both the\nobject `rt` and `neigh` are grabbed successfully, when `lifetime` is\nnonzero but the metric needs change, the function just deletes the\nroute and set `rt` to NULL. Then, it may try grabbing `rt` and `neigh`\nagain if above conditions hold. The function simply overwrite `neigh`\nif succeeds or returns if fails, without decreasing the reference\ncount of previous `neigh`. This may result in memory leaks.\n\nFix it by decrementing the reference count of `neigh` in place.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
