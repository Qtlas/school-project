Prior to version 2.3.0.0, there is a potential for a cross-site scripting vulnerability in ESAPI caused by a incorrect regular expression for \"onsiteURL\" in the **antisamy-esapi.xml** configuration file that can cause \"javascript:\" URLs to fail to be correctly sanitized. This issue is patched in ESAPI 2.3.0.0. As a workaround, manually edit the **antisamy-esapi.xml** configuration files to change the \"onsiteURL\" regular expression. More information about remediation of the vulnerability, including the workaround, is available in the maintainers' release notes and security bulletin.", "PRODUIT": ["netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$oncommand_workflow_automation", "oracle", "oracle$PRODUCT$weblogic_server", "owasp", "owasp$PRODUCT$enterprise_security_api"]}
