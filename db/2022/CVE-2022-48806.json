If count == 256 after taking into account the\noffset and page boundary, the cast to u8 overflows.  And this is common\nwhen user space tries to read the entire EEPROM at once.\n\nTo fix it, limit each read to I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX (32) bytes, already\nthe maximum length i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated() allows.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
