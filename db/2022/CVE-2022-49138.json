Therefore, consequent events for a single\nconnection are ignored.\n\nThe conn->state can hold different values, therefore HCI_CONN_HANDLE_UNSET\nis introduced to identify new connections. To make sure the events do not\ncontain this or another invalid handle HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX and checks\nare introduced.\n\nBuglink: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215497", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
