An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager", "netapp$PRODUCT$bootstrap_os", "netapp$PRODUCT$e-series_performance_analyzer", "netapp$PRODUCT$element_software", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci", "netapp$PRODUCT$hci_compute_node", "netapp$PRODUCT$management_services_for_element_software", "netapp$PRODUCT$ontap_select_deploy_administration_utility", "python", "python$PRODUCT$python"]}
