Versions 1.x prior to 1.44.7, 2.x prior to 2.15.3, and 3.x prior to 3.4.3 encounter an issue when the filesystem loader loads templates for which the name is a user input. It is possible to use the `source` or `include` statement to read arbitrary files from outside the templates' directory when using a namespace like `@somewhere/../some.file`. In such a case, validation is bypassed. Versions 1.44.7, 2.15.3, and 3.4.3 contain a fix for validation of such template names. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "drupal", "drupal$PRODUCT$drupal", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "symfony", "symfony$PRODUCT$twig"]}
