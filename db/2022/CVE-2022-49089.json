It also asserts using lockdep\nthat both of those locks are held.  However, the commit I referenced in\nFixes accidentally makes the call to rvt_error_qp in rvt_ruc_loopback no\nlonger covered by r_lock.  This results in the lockdep assertion failing\nand also possibly in a race condition.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
