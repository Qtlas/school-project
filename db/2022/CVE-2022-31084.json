In versions prior to 8.0 There are cases where LAM instantiates objects from arbitrary classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor argument. This can lead to code execution if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "ldap-account-manager", "ldap-account-manager$PRODUCT$ldap_account_manager"]}
