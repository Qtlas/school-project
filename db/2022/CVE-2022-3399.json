This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected /wp-admin/admin.php?page=cookie-notice page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "VENDOR": []}
