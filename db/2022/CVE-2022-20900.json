These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w_firmware"]}
