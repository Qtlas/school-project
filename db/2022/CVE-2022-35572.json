This web page calls a show_sysinfo function which retrieves WPA passwords, SSIDs, MAC Addresses, serial numbers, WPS Pins, and hardware/firmware versions, and prints this information into the web page. This web page is visible when remote management is enabled. A user who has access to the web interface of the device can extract these secrets. If the device has remote management enabled and is connected directly to the internet, this vulnerability is exploitable over the internet without interaction.", "VENDOR": ["linksys", "linksys$PRODUCT$e5350", "linksys$PRODUCT$e5350_firmware"]}
