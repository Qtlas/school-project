This leads to an increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The firmware versions <=1.10.1 allow to optionally disable device configuration over the network interfaces. Please make sure that you apply general security practices when operating the SIM4000. A fix is planned but not yet scheduled.", "VENDOR": ["sick", "sick$PRODUCT$sim1000_fx", "sick$PRODUCT$sim1000_fx_firmware", "sick$PRODUCT$sim1004", "sick$PRODUCT$sim1004_firmware", "sick$PRODUCT$sim1012", "sick$PRODUCT$sim1012_firmware", "sick$PRODUCT$sim2000", "sick$PRODUCT$sim2000_firmware", "sick$PRODUCT$sim2000st", "sick$PRODUCT$sim2000st_firmware", "sick$PRODUCT$sim2500", "sick$PRODUCT$sim2500_firmware", "sick$PRODUCT$sim4000", "sick$PRODUCT$sim4000_firmware"]}
