Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof events in the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot. We recommend upgrading to Version 0.4.0 or above.", "PRODUIT": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$go-attestation"]}
