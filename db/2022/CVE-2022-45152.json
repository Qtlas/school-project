This flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in LTI provider library. The library does not utilise Moodle's inbuilt cURL helper, which resulted in a blind SSRF risk. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request and trick the application to initiate requests to arbitrary systems. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$extra_packages_for_enterprise_linux", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "moodle", "moodle$PRODUCT$moodle"]}
