The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of the `tree_path` parameter during file uploads. An attacker can set `tree_path=.git.` to upload a file into the .git directory, allowing them to write or rewrite the `.git/config` file. If the `core.sshCommand` is set, this can lead to remote command execution.", "PRODUIT": "gogs"}
