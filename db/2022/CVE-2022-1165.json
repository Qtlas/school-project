This could result in blocking arbitrary IP addresses, such as legitimate/good search engine crawlers / bots. This could also be abused by competitors to cause damage related to visibility in search engines, can be used to bypass arbitrary blocks caused by this plugin, block any visitor or even the administrator and even more.", "PRODUIT": ["plugin-planet", "plugin-planet$PRODUCT$blackhole_for_bad_bots"]}
