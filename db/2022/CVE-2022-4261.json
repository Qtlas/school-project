This failure could allow an attacker to provide a malicious update and alter the functionality of Rapid7 Nexpose. The attacker would need some pre-existing mechanism to provide a malicious update, either through a social engineering effort, privileged access to replace downloaded updates in transit, or by performing an Attacker-in-the-Middle attack on the update service itself.\n\n", "PRODUIT": ["rapid7", "rapid7$PRODUCT$insightvm", "rapid7$PRODUCT$nexpose"]}
