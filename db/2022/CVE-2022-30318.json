According to FSCT-2022-0056, there is a Honeywell ControlEdge hardcoded credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: SSH. The potential impact is: Remote code execution, manipulate configuration, denial of service. The Honeywell ControlEdge PLC and RTU product line exposes an SSH service on port 22/TCP. Login as root to this service is permitted and credentials for the root user are hardcoded without automatically changing them upon first commissioning. The credentials for the SSH service are hardcoded in the firmware. The credentials grant an attacker access to a root shell on the PLC/RTU, allowing for remote code execution, configuration manipulation and denial of service.", "VENDOR": ["honeywell", "honeywell$PRODUCT$controledge_plc", "honeywell$PRODUCT$controledge_plc_firmware", "honeywell$PRODUCT$controledge_rtu", "honeywell$PRODUCT$controledge_rtu_firmware"]}
