An attacker may introduce characters through HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This could, in turn, be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server. Note: the 6.0.x LTS series (before 6.0.11) is affected.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "varnish-software", "varnish-software$PRODUCT$varnish_cache", "varnish-software$PRODUCT$varnish_cache_plus", "varnish_cache_project", "varnish_cache_project$PRODUCT$varnish_cache"]}
