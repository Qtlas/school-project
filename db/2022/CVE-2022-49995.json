However,\nwb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation dwork after\nthis has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the\njust freed bdi_writeback.\n\nFix this by checking if the bdi_writeback is alive, similar to when\nscheduling writeback work.\n\nSince this requires wb->work_lock, and wb_inode_writeback_end() may get\ncalled from interrupt, switch wb->work_lock to an irqsafe lock.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
