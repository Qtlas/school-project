An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting through an affected device to a malicious server and receiving malformed HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asyncos", "cisco$PRODUCT$s195", "cisco$PRODUCT$s395", "cisco$PRODUCT$s695"]}
