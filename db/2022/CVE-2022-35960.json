In `core/kernels/list_kernels.cc's TensorListReserve`, `num_elements` is assumed to be a tensor of size 1. When a `num_elements` of more than 1 element is provided, then `tf.raw_ops.TensorListReserve` fails the `CHECK_EQ` in `CheckIsAlignedAndSingleElement`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit b5f6fbfba76576202b72119897561e3bd4f179c7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$tensorflow"]}
