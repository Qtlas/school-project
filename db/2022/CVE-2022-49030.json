Only\ncasting max_entries to size_t is not enough, because for 32-bits\napplication on 64-bits kernel the size of read-only mmap region\nalso could overflow size_t.\n\nSo fixing it by casting the size of read-only mmap region into a __u64\nand checking whether or not there will be overflow during mmap.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
