The device runs a CGI binary (index.cgi) to offer a management web application. Once authenticated with valid credentials in this web portal, a potential attacker could submit any \"Address\" value and it would be copied to a second variable with a \"strcpy\" vulnerable function without checking its length. Because of this, it is possible to send a long address value to overflow the process stack, controlling the function return address.", "PRODUIT": ["circutor", "circutor$PRODUCT$compact_dc-s_basic", "circutor$PRODUCT$compact_dc-s_basic_firmware"]}
