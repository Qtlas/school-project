The affected system allows to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to Java objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.", "VENDOR": ["siemens", "siemens$PRODUCT$sinec_network_management_system"]}
