This vulnerability is due to improper handling of undefined command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted command on the CLI or by submitting a crafted HTTPS request to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module. Note: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative access to the Cisco ASA. A user who has administrative access to a particular Cisco ASA is also expected to have administrative access to the ASA FirePOWER module that is hosted by that Cisco ASA.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asa_firepower", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_1010", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_1120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_1140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_1150", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2110", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2130", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_2140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4110", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4112", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4115", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4120", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4125", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4140", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4145", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_4150", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_9300", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_management_center", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_management_center_virtual_appliance"]}
