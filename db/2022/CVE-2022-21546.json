If this bit is set using commands\nlike \"sg_write_same --ndob\" we will crash in target_core_iblock/file's\nexecute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg\nbecause its NULL.\n\nThis patch adds a check for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME code\nbecause we don't support it. And, it adds a check for zero SG elements in\neach handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal WRITE SAME with\nno data buffer.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
