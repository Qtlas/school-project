This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization while querying the external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted query through an external authentication web page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, including user credentials from the external authentication server. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid operator-level (or higher) credentials.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$email_security_appliance", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_email_and_web_manager"]}
