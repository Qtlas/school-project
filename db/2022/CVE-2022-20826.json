An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific memory location during the boot process of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$adaptive_security_appliance_software", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_3105", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_3110", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_3120", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_3130", "cisco$PRODUCT$secure_firewall_3140"]}
