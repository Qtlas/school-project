This is\ncommonly triggered by code calling del_timer() instead of\ndel_timer_sync() just before freeing.\n\nOne possible culprit is the hci_qca driver, which does exactly that.\n\nEric mentioned that wake_retrans_timer could be rearmed via the work\nqueue, so also move the destruction of the work queue before\ndel_timer_sync().", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
