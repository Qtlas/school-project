This leads to an Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability which allows attackers to access the application source code. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the retrieved source code is only the DevExpress client-side application code that is, of course, intentionally readable by web browsers (a site's custom code and data is never accessible via an IDOR approach).", "PRODUIT": ["devexpress", "devexpress$PRODUCT$asp.net_web_forms_controls"]}
