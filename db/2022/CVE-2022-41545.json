Because the web server also does not utilize transport security by default, this renders the administrative credentials vulnerable to eavesdropping by an adversary during every authenticated request made by a client to the router over a WLAN, or a LAN, should the adversary be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.", "VENDOR": ["netgear", "netgear$PRODUCT$c7800", "netgear$PRODUCT$c7800_firmware"]}
