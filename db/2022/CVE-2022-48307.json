A malicious attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow them to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the affected service. In the case of a successful man in the middle attack on magritte-ftp, an attacker would be able to read and modify network traffic such as authentication tokens or raw data entering a Palantir Foundry stack.", "VENDOR": ["palantir", "palantir$PRODUCT$magritte-ftp"]}
