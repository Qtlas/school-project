This allows attackers to craft a malicious serialized object that, if opened by a local user in Connected Components Workbench, may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability requires user interaction to be successfully exploited", "VENDOR": ["rockwellautomation", "rockwellautomation$PRODUCT$connected_component_workbench", "rockwellautomation$PRODUCT$isagraf_workbench", "rockwellautomation$PRODUCT$safety_instrumented_systems_workstation"]}
