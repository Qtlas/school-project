This issue would affect users of shared computers more (especially if cookies are not cleared), due to a lack of root session validation, and the reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions. This enables an attacker to resolve a user session attached to a previously authenticated user; when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued a token for the original user.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$keycloak", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform_for_linuxone", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform_for_power", "redhat$PRODUCT$openshift_container_platform_ibm_z_systems", "redhat$PRODUCT$single_sign-on"]}
