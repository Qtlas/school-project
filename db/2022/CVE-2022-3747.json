This is due to missing nonce validation when saving the plugin's settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings like betheme_url_slug, replaced_theme_author, and betheme_label to name a few, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "VENDOR": ["muffingroup", "muffingroup$PRODUCT$becustom"]}
