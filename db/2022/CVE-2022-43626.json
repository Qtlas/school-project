Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SetIPv4FirewallSettings requests to the web management portal. When parsing subelements within the IPv4FirewallRule element, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call.
