This allows the attacker to get valid sessions for arbitrary users, and optionally reset their password. Tested and confirmed in a default installation of version 7.2.3. Earlier versions are affected, possibly earlier major versions as well.", "VENDOR": ["b2evolution", "b2evolution$PRODUCT$b2evolution"]}
