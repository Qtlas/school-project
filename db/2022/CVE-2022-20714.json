This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed packets that are received on the Lightspeed-Plus line cards. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Lightspeed-Plus line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for any traffic that traverses that line card.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9902", "cisco$PRODUCT$asr_9903", "cisco$PRODUCT$ios_xr"]}
