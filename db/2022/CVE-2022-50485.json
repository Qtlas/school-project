However, if iget the boot loader inode, allows a bad\ninode to be returned, because the inode may not be initialized. This\nmechanism can be used to bypass some checks and cause panic. To solve this\nproblem, we add a special iget flag EXT4_IGET_BAD. Only with this flag\nwe'd be returning bad inode from ext4_iget(), otherwise we always return\nthe error code if the inode is bad inode.(suggested by Jan Kara)", "VENDOR": []}
