In pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
