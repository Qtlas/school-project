{"CVE": "CVE-2022-21677", "CWE": ["CWE-200"], "DATE": "2022-01-14T17:15:13.153000+00:00", "CVSS": 4.3, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "Group advanced search option may leak group and group's members visibility ", "DESC": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Discourse groups can be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as the group members. By default, a newly created group has its visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 2.7.13 and 2.8.0.beta11 where the group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with the right search option. This issue is patched in `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11 versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "VENDOR": ["discourse", "discourse$PRODUCT$discourse"]}
