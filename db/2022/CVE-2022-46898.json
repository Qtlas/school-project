There is Path Traversal via the \"restore SQL data\" filename. The Vocera Report Console contains a websocket function that allows for the restoration of the database from a ZIP archive that expects a SQL import file. The filename provided is not properly sanitized and allows for the inclusion of a path-traversal payload that can be used to escape the intended Vocera restoration directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to point to a crafted ZIP archive that contains SQL commands that could be executed against the database.", "PRODUIT": "vocera"}
