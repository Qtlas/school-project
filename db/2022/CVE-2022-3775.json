As consequence an attacker can craft an input which will lead to a out-of-bounds write into grub2's heap, leading to memory corruption and availability issues. Although complex, arbitrary code execution could not be discarded.", "PRODUIT": ["gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$grub2", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
