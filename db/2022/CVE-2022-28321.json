The pam_access.so module doesn't correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue is largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not affect Linux-PAM upstream.", "VENDOR": ["linux-pam", "linux-pam$PRODUCT$linux-pam", "opensuse", "opensuse$PRODUCT$tumbleweed"]}
