Upon failure on the\nVMID allocations, the new code would branch to the 'out' label, which\nreturns NULL without unwinding anything, thus skipping the call to\nscsi_host_put().\n\nFix the problem by creating a separate label 'out_free_vmid' to unwind the\nVMID resources and make the 'out_put_shost' label call only\nscsi_host_put(), as was done before the introduction of allocations for\nVMID.", "PRODUIT": ""}
