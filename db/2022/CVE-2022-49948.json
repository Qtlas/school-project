A previous selection may thus now\nbe outside of the new screen size and thus trigger out-of-bounds\naccesses to graphics memory if the selection is removed in\nvc_do_resize().\n\nPrevent such out-of-memory accesses by dropping the selection before the\nvarious con_font_set() console handlers are called.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
