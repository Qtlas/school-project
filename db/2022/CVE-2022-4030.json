This makes it possible with attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply paths to arbitrary files on the server that will subsequently be deleted. This can be used to delete the wp-config.php file that can allow an attacker to configure the site and achieve remote code execution.", "VENDOR": ["simple-press", "simple-press$PRODUCT$simple\\"]}
