A module with a sufficiently large signature field causes a stack overflow, affecting secure kernel data pages. This can be leveraged to obtain arbitrary code execution in secure supervisor context by overwriting a SHA256 function pointer in the secure kernel data area when loading a forged, unsigned SK_LOAD module encrypted with the CEK (obtainable through CVE-2022-25332). This constitutes a full break of the TEE security architecture.", "VENDOR": ["ti", "ti$PRODUCT$omap_l138", "ti$PRODUCT$omap_l138_firmware"]}
