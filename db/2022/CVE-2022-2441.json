This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to run arbitrary commands leading to remote command execution, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This makes it possible for an attacker to create and or modify files hosted on the server which can easily grant attackers backdoor access to the affected server.", "VENDOR": ["orangelab", "orangelab$PRODUCT$imagemagick_engine"]}
