User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of OBJ files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16174.", "VENDOR": ["bentley", "bentley$PRODUCT$microstation", "bentley$PRODUCT$view"]}
