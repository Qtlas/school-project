Prior to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo Events version 1.7.1.", "VENDOR": ["argo_events_project", "argo_events_project$PRODUCT$argo_events"]}
