The \u201csearch term\" search functionality is not sufficiently sanitized while displaying the results of the search, which can be leveraged to inject arbitrary scripts. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they enter the crafted URL. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, by an unauthenticated attacker.", "VENDOR": ["sismics", "sismics$PRODUCT$teedy"]}
