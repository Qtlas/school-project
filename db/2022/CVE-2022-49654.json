This cause the mgmt ethernet\nsystem to not receive any packet (the slow fallback still works) and\nmakes the device not reachable. To recover from this a switch reset is\nrequired.\n\nTo correctly handle this, turn off the cpu ports before changing the\nMAX_FRAME_SIZE and turn on again after the value is applied.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
