Improper access control on the wirelesssetup.asp interface allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to obtain the WPA passphrases for the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz wireless networks. This is particularly dangerous given that the K2G setup wizard presents the user with the option of using the same password for the 2.4Ghz network and the administrative interface, by clicking a checkbox. When Remote Managment is enabled, these endpoints are exposed to the WAN.", "VENDOR": ["phicomm", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2g", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2g_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2p", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2p_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3c", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3c_firmware"]}
