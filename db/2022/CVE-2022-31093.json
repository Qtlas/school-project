In affected versions an attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced Initialization.
