This weakness allows the attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd startup state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device, by means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but K2 22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires the exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219).", "PRODUIT": ["phicomm", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2g", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2g_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2p", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2p_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3c", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3c_firmware"]}
