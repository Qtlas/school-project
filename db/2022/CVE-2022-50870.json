Its behavior depends on a couple\nof conditions in the /rtas node of the device tree, the traversal of\nwhich entails locking and local IRQ state changes. If the kernel panics\nwhile devtree_lock is held, rtas_os_term() as currently written could\nhang.\n\nInstead of discovering the relevant characteristics at panic time,\ncache them in file-static variables at boot. Note the lookup for\n\"ibm,extended-os-term\" is converted to of_property_read_bool() since it\nis a boolean property, not an RTAS function token.\n\n[mpe: Incorporate suggested change from Nick]", "VENDOR": []}
