This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device using root-level privileges. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv110w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv130w_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w", "cisco$PRODUCT$rv215w_firmware"]}
