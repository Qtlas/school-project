NFSv3 and\nNFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there\nis a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that is\nalready larger than Linux can handle.\n\nCurrently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If\nthat value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_size\nunderflows. I'm about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let's\ncatch the underflow in the common code path: nfsd_setattr().", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
