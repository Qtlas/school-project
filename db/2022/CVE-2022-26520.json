An example situation is that an attacker could create an executable JSP file under a Tomcat web root. NOTE: the vendor's position is that there is no pgjdbc vulnerability; instead, it is a vulnerability for any application to use the pgjdbc driver with untrusted connection properties", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "postgresql", "postgresql$PRODUCT$postgresql_jdbc_driver"]}
