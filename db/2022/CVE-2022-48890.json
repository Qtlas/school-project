If the I/O\nsubmission fails in storvsc_do_io(), the I/O is typically retried by higher\nlevel code, but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like\ncause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer, which\nis not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer\nmemory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem\ncan arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter\nswiotlb=force.\n\nFix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission\nerror, which frees the bounce buffer memory.", "PRODUIT": "linux"}
