When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$gzip", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_data_grid", "tukaani", "tukaani$PRODUCT$xz"]}
