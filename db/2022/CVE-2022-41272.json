This allows the attacker to have full read access to user data, make limited modifications to user data, and degrade the performance of the system, leading to a high impact on confidentiality and a limited impact on the availability and integrity of the application.\n", "VENDOR": ["sap", "sap$PRODUCT$netweaver_process_integration"]}
