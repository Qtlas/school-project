A flaw was found in REST API in StarWind Stack. REST command, which allows changing the hostname, doesn\u2019t check a new hostname parameter. It goes directly to bash as part of a script. An attacker with non-root user access can inject arbitrary data into the command that will be executed with root privileges.", "VENDOR": ["starwindsoftware", "starwindsoftware$PRODUCT$starwind_san_\\&_nas"]}
