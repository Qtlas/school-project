A use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sq in fs/io_uring.c allows an attacker to crash the kernel, resulting in denial of service. finish_wait can be skipped. An attack can occur in some situations by forking a process and then quickly terminating it. NOTE: later kernel versions, such as the 5.15 longterm series, substantially changed the implementation of io_sqpoll_wait_sq.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
