An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause LLDP to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_190", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_190_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_191", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_191_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_192", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_192_firmware"]}
