Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorToCSRSparseMatrix` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code assumes `dense_shape` is a vector and `indices` is a matrix (as part of requirements for sparse tensors) but there is no validation for this. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.", "VENDOR": ["google", "google$PRODUCT$tensorflow"]}
