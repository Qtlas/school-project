In versions before `11.33.0`, when the \u201cadditional signup fields\u201d feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property). Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the \u201cadditional signup fields\u201d feature in your application. Upgrade to version `11.33.0`.", "PRODUIT": ["auth0", "auth0$PRODUCT$lock"]}
