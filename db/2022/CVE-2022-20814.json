An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a man-in-the-middle technique to intercept the traffic between the devices, and then using a self-signed certificate to impersonate the endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the intercepted traffic in clear text or alter the contents of the traffic.\r\nNote: Cisco&nbsp;Expressway-E is not affected by this vulnerability.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$telepresence_video_communication_server"]}
