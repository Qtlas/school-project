These applications allow executable Python code to be embedded in Universal Scene Description (USD) files to customize all aspects of a scene. If a user opens a USD file that contains embedded Python code in one of these applications, the embedded Python code automatically runs with the privileges of the user who opened the file. As a result, an unprivileged remote attacker could craft a USD file containing malicious Python code and persuade a local user to open the file, which may lead to information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service.\n\n", "VENDOR": ["nvidia", "nvidia$PRODUCT$nvidia_isaac_sim", "nvidia$PRODUCT$omniverse_audio2face", "nvidia$PRODUCT$omniverse_code", "nvidia$PRODUCT$omniverse_create", "nvidia$PRODUCT$omniverse_machinima", "nvidia$PRODUCT$omniverse_view"]}
