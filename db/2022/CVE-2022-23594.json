{"CVE": "CVE-2022-23594", "CWE": ["CWE-125", "CWE-787"], "DATE": "2022-02-04 23:15:15", "SCORE": 8.8, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "TITLE": "Out of bounds read in Tensorflow", "DESC": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We will patch them as they are discovered.", "PRODUIT": "google"}
