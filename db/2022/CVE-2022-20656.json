To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files to the host system.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$evolved_programmable_network_manager", "cisco$PRODUCT$prime_infrastructure"]}
