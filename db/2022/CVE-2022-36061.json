In versions prior to 1.3.35, read only calls between contracts can generate smart contracts results. For example, if contract A calls in read only mode contract B and the called function will make changes upon the contract's B state, the state will be altered for contract B as if the call was not made in the read-only mode. This can lead to some effects not designed by the original smart contracts programmers. This issue was patched in version 1.3.35. There are no known workarounds.", "PRODUIT": "elrond"}
