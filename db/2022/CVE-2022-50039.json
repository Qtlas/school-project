This causes kernel panic on the second call.\n\"\n\nHowever later on, commit 5ec55823438e8 (\"net: stmmac: add clocks management\nfor gmac driver\") has updated stmmac_dvr_remove() which do not call\nclk_disable_unprepare() anymore.\n\nSo this call should now be called from intel_eth_pci_remove().", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
