This can lead to the mitigations bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure, discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally, an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM memory. This issue affects: Module name: SbPei SHA256: d827182e5f9b7a9ff0b9d3e232f7cfac43b5237e2681e11f005be627a49283a9 Module GUID: c1fbd624-27ea-40d1-aa48-94c3dc5c7e0d", "PRODUIT": "intel"}
