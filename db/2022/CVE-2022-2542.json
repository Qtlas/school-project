This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/app/sites/ajax/actions/keyword_save.php file that is called via the doAjax() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "PRODUIT": ["summitmediaconcepts", "summitmediaconcepts$PRODUCT$ucontext_for_clickbank"]}
