If we\nalso have two netdevs (first one need only be a wdev though)\nthen we can find one during the first iteration, close it,\nand go to the second iteration -- but then find two, and try\nto destroy also the one we didn't close yet.\n\nFix this by only iterating once.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
