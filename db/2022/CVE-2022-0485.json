When performing multi-threaded copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly treating the completion of an asynchronous command as successful, rather than checking the *error parameter. This could result in the silent creation of a corrupted destination image.", "PRODUIT": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$libnbd"]}
