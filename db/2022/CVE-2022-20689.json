An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid Cisco Discovery Protocol packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal Cisco Discovery Protocol database of the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_190", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_190_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_191", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_191_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_192", "cisco$PRODUCT$ata_192_firmware"]}
