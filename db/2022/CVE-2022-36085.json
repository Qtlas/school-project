The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe \u2014 and as such rejected \u2014 by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn\u2019t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities` feature instead.", "VENDOR": ["openpolicyagent", "openpolicyagent$PRODUCT$open_policy_agent"]}
