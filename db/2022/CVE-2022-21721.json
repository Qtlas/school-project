{"CVE": "CVE-2022-21721", "CWE": ["NVD-CWE-noinfo"], "DATE": "2022-01-28T22:15:16", "CVSS": 5.9, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "TITLE": "DOS Vulnerability in next.js", "DESC": "Next.js is a React framework. Starting with version 12.0.0 and prior to version 12.0.9, vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone using i18n functionality. In order to be affected by this CVE, one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade.", "VENDOR": ["vercel", "vercel$PRODUCT$next.js"]}
