By crafting a BGP OPEN message with an option of type 0xff (Extended Length from RFC 9072), attackers may cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon restart, or out-of-bounds read). This is possible because of inconsistent boundary checks that do not account for reading 3 bytes (instead of 2) in this 0xff case.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "frrouting", "frrouting$PRODUCT$frrouting"]}
