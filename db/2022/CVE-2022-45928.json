Multiple endpoints allow the user to pass the parameter htmlFile, which is included in the HTML output rendering pipeline of a request. Because the Content Server evaluates and executes Oscript code in HTML files, it is possible for an attacker to execute Oscript code. The Oscript scripting language allows the attacker (for example) to manipulate files on the filesystem, create new network connections, or execute OS commands.", "VENDOR": ["opentext", "opentext$PRODUCT$opentext_extended_ecm"]}
