Dart uses the RFC 3986 syntax, which creates incompatibilities with the '\\' characters in URIs, which can lead to auth bypass in webapps interpreting URIs. We recommend updating Dart or Flutter to mitigate the issue.", "PRODUIT": ["dart", "dart$PRODUCT$dart_software_development_kit", "flutter", "flutter$PRODUCT$flutter"]}
