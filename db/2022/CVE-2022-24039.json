The \u201caddCell\u201d JavaScript function fails to properly sanitize user-controllable input before including it into the generated XML body of the XLS report document, such that it is possible to inject arbitrary content (e.g., XML tags) into the generated file. An attacker with restricted privileges, by poisoning any of the content used to generate XLS reports, could be able to leverage the application to deliver malicious files against higher-privileged users and obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE) against the administrator\u2019s workstation.", "VENDOR": ["siemens", "siemens$PRODUCT$desigo_pxc4", "siemens$PRODUCT$desigo_pxc4_firmware", "siemens$PRODUCT$desigo_pxc5", "siemens$PRODUCT$desigo_pxc5_firmware"]}
