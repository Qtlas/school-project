The error handling in kvm_ioctl_create_device()\nassumes destroy() is always defined which leads to NULL dereference as\ndiscovered by Syzkaller.\n\nThis adds a checks for destroy!=NULL and adds a missing release().\n\nThis is not changing kvm_destroy_devices() as devices with defined\nrelease() should have been removed from the KVM devices list by then.", "VENDOR": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
