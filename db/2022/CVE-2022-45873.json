This occurs in parse_elf_object in shared/elf-util.c. The exploitation methodology is to crash a binary calling the same function recursively, and put it in a deeply nested directory to make its backtrace large enough to cause the deadlock. This must be done 16 times when MaxConnections=16 is set for the systemd/units/systemd-coredump.socket file.", "VENDOR": ["fedoraproject", "fedoraproject$PRODUCT$fedora", "systemd_project", "systemd_project$PRODUCT$systemd"]}
