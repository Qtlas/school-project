In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "ldap-account-manager", "ldap-account-manager$PRODUCT$ldap_account_manager"]}
