This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain parameters within association request frames received by the AP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted 802.11 association request to a nearby device. An exploit could allow the attacker to unexpectedly reload the device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-40_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-80_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-cl_firmware", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l", "cisco$PRODUCT$catalyst_9800-l_firmware"]}
