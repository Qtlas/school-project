Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.", "VENDOR": ["github", "github$PRODUCT$viewcomponent"]}
