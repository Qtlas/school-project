By means of a crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker on the local network can leverage this null byte interaction error in such a way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with 1-in-94 odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by the OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher (CVE-2022-25218).", "VENDOR": ["phicomm", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2g", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2g_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2p", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k2p_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3_firmware", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3c", "phicomm$PRODUCT$k3c_firmware"]}
