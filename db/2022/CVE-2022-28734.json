This can lead to a out-of-bound write further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.", "PRODUIT": ["gnu", "gnu$PRODUCT$grub2", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$active_iq_unified_manager"]}
