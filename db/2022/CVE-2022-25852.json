This happens for every non-array argument passed. **Note:** pg-native is a mere binding to npm's libpq library, which in turn has the addons and bindings to the actual C libpq library. This means that problems found in pg-native may transitively impact npm's libpq.", "PRODUIT": ["libpq_project", "libpq_project$PRODUCT$libpq", "pg-native_project", "pg-native_project$PRODUCT$pg-native"]}
