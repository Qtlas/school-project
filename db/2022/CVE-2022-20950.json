An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted SIP traffic through an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a restart of the Snort 3 process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$firepower_threat_defense"]}
