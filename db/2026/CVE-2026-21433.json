{"CVE": "CVE-2026-21433", "CWE": ["CWE-918"], "DATE": "2026-01-02T19:15:48", "CVSS": 7.7, "METRIC": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "TITLE": "Emlog vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "DESC": "Emlog is an open source website building system. Versions up to and including 2.5.19 are vulnerable to server-side Out-of-Band (OOB) requests / SSRF via uploaded SVG files. An attacker can upload a crafted SVG to http[:]//emblog/admin/media[.]php which contains external resource references. When the server processes/renders the SVG (thumbnailing, preview, or sanitization), it issues an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled host. Impact: server-side SSRF/OOB leading to internal network probing and potential metadata/credential exposure. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "VENDOR": []}
