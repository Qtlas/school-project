{"CVE": "CVE-2026-21428", "CWE": ["CWE-93"], "DATE": "2026-01-01T18:15:41", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "cpp-httplib has CRLF injection in http headers", "DESC": "cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior to version 0.30.0, the ``write_headers`` function does not check for CR & LF characters in user supplied headers, allowing untrusted header value to escape header lines.\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to add extra headers, modify request body unexpectedly & trigger an SSRF attack. When combined with a server that supports http1.1 pipelining (springboot, python twisted etc), this can be used for server side request forgery (SSRF). Version 0.30.0 fixes this issue.", "VENDOR": []}
