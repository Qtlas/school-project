The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in mew packet files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a heap-based buffer over-read condition in mew.c when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["clamav", "clamav$PRODUCT$clamav", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
