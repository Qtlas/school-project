{"CVE": "CVE-2017-20211", "CWE": ["CWE-823"], "DATE": "2025-11-12T22:15:41.660000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "UCanCode E-XD++ Visualization Enterprise Suite Untrusted Pointer Dereference RCE", "DESC": "UCanCode E-XD++ Visualization Enterprise Suite contains an untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability via the TKDRAWCAD.TKDrawCADCtrl.1 ActiveX control. This is because it exposes a RotateShape method that dereferences a user-supplied pointer without sufficient validation. A crafted input may cause the control to dereference an attacker-controlled pointer, enabling remote code execution in the context of the hosting process. The vulnerability requires user interaction (instantiation of the ActiveX control via a web page or a file).", "VENDOR": []}
