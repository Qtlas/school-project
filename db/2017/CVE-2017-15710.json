If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.", "PRODUIT": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$http_server", "canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "netapp", "netapp$PRODUCT$clustered_data_ontap", "netapp$PRODUCT$santricity_cloud_connector", "netapp$PRODUCT$storage_automation_store", "netapp$PRODUCT$storagegrid", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux"]}
