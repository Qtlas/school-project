The attacker can persistently make the (locked) bootloader start the platform with dm-verity disabled, by issuing the 'fastboot oem disable_dm_verity' command. Having dm-verity disabled, the kernel will not verify the system partition (and any other dm-verity protected partition), which may allow for persistent code execution and privilege escalation.", "PRODUIT": "oneplus"}
