The software uses risky cryptographic algorithm in SSL. This is dangerous because a remote unauthenticated attacker could use well-known techniques to break the algorithm. Successful exploit could result in the exposure of sensitive information.", "VENDOR": ["huawei", "huawei$PRODUCT$dp300", "huawei$PRODUCT$dp300_firmware", "huawei$PRODUCT$tp3206", "huawei$PRODUCT$tp3206_firmware", "huawei$PRODUCT$viewpoint_9030", "huawei$PRODUCT$viewpoint_9030_firmware"]}
