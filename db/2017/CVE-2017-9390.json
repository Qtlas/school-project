The device provides a shell script called connect.sh which is supposed to return a specific cookie for the user when the user is authenticated to https://home.getvera.com. One of the parameters retrieved by this script is \"RedirectURL\". However, the application lacks strict input validation of this parameter and this allows an attacker to execute the client-side code on this application.", "VENDOR": ["getvera", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge_firmware", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite_firmware"]}
