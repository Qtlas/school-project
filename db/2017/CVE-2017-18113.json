The vulnerability allowed for various problematic OSWorkflow classes to be used as part of workflows. The fix for this issue blocks usage of unsafe conditions, validators, functions and registers that are build-in into OSWorkflow library and other Jira dependencies. Atlassian-made functions or functions provided by 3rd party plugins are not affected by this fix.", "VENDOR": ["atlassian", "atlassian$PRODUCT$data_center", "atlassian$PRODUCT$jira"]}
