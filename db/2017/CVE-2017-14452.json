Specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_cc_r, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"c_r\" parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["insteon", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub_firmware"]}
