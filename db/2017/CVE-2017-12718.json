A third-party component used in the pump does not verify input buffer size prior to copying, leading to a buffer overflow, allowing remote code execution on the target device. The pump receives the potentially malicious input infrequently and under certain conditions, increasing the difficulty of exploitation.", "VENDOR": ["smiths-medical", "smiths-medical$PRODUCT$medfusion_4000_wireless_syringe_infusion_pump"]}
