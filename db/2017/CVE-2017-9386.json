The device provides a script file called \"get_file.sh\" which allows a user to retrieve any file stored in the \"cmh-ext\" folder on the device. However, the \"filename\" parameter is not validated correctly and this allows an attacker to directory traverse outside the /cmh-ext folder and read any file on the device. It is necessary to create the folder \"cmh-ext\" on the device which can be executed by an attacker first in an unauthenticated fashion and then execute a directory traversal attack.", "PRODUIT": ["getvera", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge_firmware", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite_firmware"]}
