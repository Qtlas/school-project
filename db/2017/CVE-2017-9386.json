{"CVE": "CVE-2017-9386", "CWE": ["CWE-22"], "DATE": "2019-06-17T20:15:09", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a script file called \"get_file.sh\" which allows a user to retrieve any file stored in the \"cmh-ext\" folder on the device. However, the \"filename\" parameter is not validated correctly and this allows an attacker to directory traverse outside the /cmh-ext folder and read any file on the device. It is necessary to create the folder \"cmh-ext\" on the device which can be executed by an attacker first in an unauthenticated fashion and then execute a directory traversal attack.", "VENDOR": ["getvera", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge_firmware", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite_firmware"]}
