A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.", "VENDOR": ["oniguruma_project", "oniguruma_project$PRODUCT$oniguruma", "php", "php$PRODUCT$php"]}
