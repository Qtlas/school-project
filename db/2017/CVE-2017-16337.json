An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. At 0x9d01ef24 the value for the s_offset key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at $sp+0x2b0. This buffer is 32 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.", "VENDOR": ["insteon", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub_2245-222", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub_2245-222_firmware"]}
