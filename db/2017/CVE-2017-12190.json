{"CVE": "CVE-2017-12190", "CWE": ["CWE-400", "CWE-772"], "DATE": "2017-11-22 18:29:00", "SCORE": 4.9, "METRIC": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "The bio_map_user_iov and bio_unmap_user functions in block/bio.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.8 do unbalanced refcounting when a SCSI I/O vector has small consecutive buffers belonging to the same page. The bio_add_pc_page function merges them into one, but the page reference is never dropped. This causes a memory leak and possible system lockup (exploitable against the host OS by a guest OS user, if a SCSI disk is passed through to a virtual machine) due to an out-of-memory condition.", "PRODUIT": ["linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
