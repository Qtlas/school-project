As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate privileges to gain control over compute nodes.", "VENDOR": ["redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$openstack_platform"]}
