Attackers with local access could bypass the AllowChrootSymlinks control by replacing a path component (other than the last one) with a symbolic link. The threat model includes an attacker who is not granted full filesystem access by a hosting provider, but can reconfigure the home directory of an FTP user.", "PRODUIT": ["proftpd", "proftpd$PRODUCT$proftpd"]}
