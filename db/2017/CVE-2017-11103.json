In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.", "VENDOR": ["apple", "apple$PRODUCT$iphone_os", "apple$PRODUCT$mac_os_x", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "freebsd", "freebsd$PRODUCT$freebsd", "heimdal_project", "heimdal_project$PRODUCT$heimdal", "samba", "samba$PRODUCT$samba"]}
