{"CVE": "CVE-2017-16392", "CWE": ["CWE-119"], "DATE": "2017-12-09T06:29:02.087000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer access with an incorrect length value in the JPEG processing module. Crafted input with an unexpected JPEG file segment size causes a mismatch between allocated buffer size and the access allowed by the computation. If an attacker can adequately control the accessible memory then this vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.", "VENDOR": ["adobe", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat_dc", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat_reader", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat_reader_dc"]}
