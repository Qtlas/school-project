Additionally, IWSVA implements incorrect access control that allows any authenticated, remote user (even with low privileges like 'Auditor') to create or modify reports, and consequently take advantage of this XSS vulnerability. The JavaScript is executed when victims visit reports or auditlog pages.", "VENDOR": ["trendmicro", "trendmicro$PRODUCT$interscan_web_security_virtual_appliance"]}
