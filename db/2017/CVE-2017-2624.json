If the cookie is correct, it is allowed to attach to the Xorg session. Since most memcmp() implementations return after an invalid byte is seen, this causes a time difference between a valid and invalid byte, which could allow an efficient brute force attack.", "PRODUIT": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "x.org", "x.org$PRODUCT$x_server"]}
