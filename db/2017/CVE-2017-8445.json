If reloading the trust material fails the trust manager will be replaced with an instance that trusts all certificates. This could allow any node using any certificate to join a cluster. The proper behavior in this instance is for the TLS trust manager to deny all certificates.", "VENDOR": ["elastic", "elastic$PRODUCT$x-pack"]}
