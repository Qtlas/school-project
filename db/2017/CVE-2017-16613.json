The Swift object store and proxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauth middleware authentication mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request. NOTE: github.com/openstack/swauth URLs do not mean that Swauth is maintained by an official OpenStack project team.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "openstack", "openstack$PRODUCT$swauth", "openstack$PRODUCT$swift"]}
