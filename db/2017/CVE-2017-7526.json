The same attack is believed to work on RSA-2048 with moderately more computation. This side-channel requires that attacker can run arbitrary software on the hardware where the private RSA key is used.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "gnupg", "gnupg$PRODUCT$libgcrypt"]}
