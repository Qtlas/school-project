By setting a specific socket option, an attacker can control a pointer in kernel land and cause an inet_csk_listen_stop general protection fault, or potentially execute arbitrary code under certain circumstances. The issue can be triggered as root (e.g., inside a default LXC container or with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) or after namespace unsharing. This occurs because sk_type and protocol are not checked in the appropriate part of the ip6_mroute_* functions. NOTE: this affects Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.187.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel"]}
