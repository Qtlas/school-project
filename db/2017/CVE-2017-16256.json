Specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. In cmd sn_sx, at 0x9d014ebc, the value for the `cmd2` key is copied using `strcpy` to the buffer at `$sp+0x2d0`.This buffer is 100 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.", "VENDOR": ["insteon", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub_firmware"]}
