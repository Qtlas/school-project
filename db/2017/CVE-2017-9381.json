The device provides a user with the capability of installing or deleting apps on the device using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site request forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who navigates to an attacker controlled page to install or delete an application on the device. Note: The cross-site request forgery is a systemic issue across all other functionalities of the device.", "VENDOR": ["getvera", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge", "getvera$PRODUCT$veraedge_firmware", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite", "getvera$PRODUCT$veralite_firmware"]}
