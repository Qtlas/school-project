{"CVE": "CVE-2017-3226", "CWE": ["CWE-310", "CWE-329"], "DATE": "2018-07-24T15:29:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature improperly handles an error condition and may allow attacks against the underlying cryptographic implementation and allow an attacker to decrypt the data", "DESC": "Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted file. Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting the configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables from disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.", "VENDOR": ["denx", "denx$PRODUCT$u-boot"]}
