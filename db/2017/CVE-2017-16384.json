{"CVE": "CVE-2017-16384", "CWE": ["CWE-125"], "DATE": "2017-12-09 06:29:01", "SCORE": 9.3, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the exif processing module for a PNG file (during XPS conversion). Invalid input leads to a computation where pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap addresses, etc.", "PRODUIT": "adobe"}
