In the final step of \"Login with Twitter\" authentication information is passed back to the application using the registered custom URL scheme (typically twitterkit-<consumer-key>) on iOS. Because the callback handler did not verify the authenticity of the response, this step is vulnerable to forgery, potentially allowing attacker to associate a Twitter account with a third-party service.", "VENDOR": ["twitter", "twitter$PRODUCT$twitter_kit"]}
