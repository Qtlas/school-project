Some variables under user control in the MantisBT installation script are not properly sanitized before being output, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, as demonstrated by the $f_database, $f_db_username, and $f_admin_username variables. This is mitigated by the fact that the admin/ folder should be deleted after installation, and also prevented by CSP.", "PRODUIT": ["mantisbt", "mantisbt$PRODUCT$mantisbt"]}
