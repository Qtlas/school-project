Due to the user-specific configuration being loaded from \"~/.confire.yaml\" using the yaml.load function, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["confire_project", "confire_project$PRODUCT$confire"]}
