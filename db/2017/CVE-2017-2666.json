This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux", "redhat$PRODUCT$jboss_enterprise_application_platform", "redhat$PRODUCT$undertow"]}
