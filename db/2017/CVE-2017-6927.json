This function does not correctly handle all methods of injecting malicious HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability under certain circumstances. The PHP functions which Drupal provides for HTML escaping are not affected.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "drupal", "drupal$PRODUCT$drupal"]}
