Repeated crashes of the flowd process may constitute an extended denial of service condition. This service is not enabled by default and is only supported in high-end SRX platforms. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D45, 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D80 on SRX1400, SRX3400, SRX3600, SRX5400, SRX5600, SRX5800.", "VENDOR": ["juniper", "juniper$PRODUCT$junos", "juniper$PRODUCT$srx1400", "juniper$PRODUCT$srx3400", "juniper$PRODUCT$srx3600", "juniper$PRODUCT$srx5400", "juniper$PRODUCT$srx5600", "juniper$PRODUCT$srx5800"]}
