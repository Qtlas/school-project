The `login` command available in the remoting-based CLI stored the encrypted user name of the successfully authenticated user in a cache file used to authenticate further commands. Users with sufficient permission to create secrets in Jenkins, and download their encrypted values (e.g. with Job/Configure permission), were able to impersonate any other Jenkins user on the same instance.", "PRODUIT": ["jenkins", "jenkins$PRODUCT$jenkins"]}
