The related heap is allocated in the token() function and freed in the detoken() function (called by pp_getline()) - it is used again at multiple positions later that could cause multiple damages. For example, it causes a corrupted double-linked list in detoken(), a double free or corruption in delete_Token(), and an out-of-bounds write in detoken(). It has a high possibility to lead to a remote code execution attack.", "VENDOR": ["canonical", "canonical$PRODUCT$ubuntu_linux", "nasm", "nasm$PRODUCT$netwide_assembler"]}
