{"CVE": "CVE-2017-9860", "CWE": ["CWE-287"], "DATE": "2017-08-05 17:29:00", "SCORE": 10.0, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. An attacker can use Sunny Explorer or the SMAdata2+ network protocol to update the device firmware without ever having to authenticate. If an attacker is able to create a custom firmware version that is accepted by the inverter, the inverter is compromised completely. This allows the attacker to do nearly anything: for example, giving access to the local OS, creating a botnet, using the inverters as a stepping stone into companies, etc. NOTE: the vendor reports that this attack has always been blocked by \"a final integrity and compatibility check.\" Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected", "PRODUIT": "sma"}
