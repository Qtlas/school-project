This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer due to an integer overflow; the computation is part of the abstraction that creates an arbitrarily sized transparent or opaque bitmap image. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.", "VENDOR": ["adobe", "adobe$PRODUCT$flash_player", "apple", "apple$PRODUCT$macos", "google", "google$PRODUCT$chrome_os", "linux", "linux$PRODUCT$linux_kernel", "microsoft", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_10", "microsoft$PRODUCT$windows_8.1", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_desktop", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_server", "redhat$PRODUCT$enterprise_linux_workstation"]}
