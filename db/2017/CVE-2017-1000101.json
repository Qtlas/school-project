{"CVE": "CVE-2017-1000101", "CWE": ["CWE-119"], "DATE": "2017-10-05T01:29:04.103000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "curl supports \"globbing\" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.", "VENDOR": ["haxx", "haxx$PRODUCT$curl"]}
