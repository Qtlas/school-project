The device provides a user with the capability of blocking key words passing in the web traffic to prevent kids from watching content that might be deemed unsafe using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site scripting protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface into executing a stored cross-site scripting payload on the user's browser and execute any action on the device provided by the web management interface.", "VENDOR": ["securifi", "securifi$PRODUCT$almond", "securifi$PRODUCT$almond\\+", "securifi$PRODUCT$almond\\+firmware", "securifi$PRODUCT$almond_2015", "securifi$PRODUCT$almond_2015_firmware", "securifi$PRODUCT$almond_firmware"]}
