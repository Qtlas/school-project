The app_minivm module has an \"externnotify\" program configuration option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the caller-id name and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number can come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an arbitrary shell command injection.", "PRODUIT": ["digium", "digium$PRODUCT$asterisk", "digium$PRODUCT$certified_asterisk"]}
