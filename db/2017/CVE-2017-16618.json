A \"Load YAML\" string or file (aka load_yaml or load_yamlf) can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.", "PRODUIT": ["owlmixin_project", "owlmixin_project$PRODUCT$owlmixin"]}
