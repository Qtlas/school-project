When signed into Sunny Explorer with a wrong password, it is possible to create a debug report, disclosing information regarding the application and allowing the attacker to create and save a .txt file with contents to his liking. An attacker may use this for information disclosure, or to write a file to normally unavailable locations on the local system. NOTE: the vendor reports that \"the information contained in the debug report is of marginal significance.\" Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected", "VENDOR": ["sma", "sma$PRODUCT$sunny_explorer"]}
