NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for supporting arbitrary password changes by customers; however, a password change is optional to meet different customers' needs", "PRODUIT": ["riverbed", "riverbed$PRODUCT$rios"]}
