{"CVE": "CVE-2017-7660", "CWE": ["CWE-287"], "DATE": "2017-07-07 19:29:00", "SCORE": 5.0, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "Apache Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either \"HttpClientInterceptorPlugin\" or \"HttpClientBuilderPlugin\", his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected.", "PRODUIT": "apache"}
