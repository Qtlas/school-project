Parsing the numeric header fields in a SIP message (like cseq, ttl, port, etc.) all had the potential to overflow, either causing unintended values to be captured or, if the values were subsequently converted back to strings, a buffer overrun. This will lead to a potential exploit using carefully crafted invalid values.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "teluu", "teluu$PRODUCT$pjsip"]}
