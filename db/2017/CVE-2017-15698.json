The result of the parsing error was to skip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible for client certificates that should have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["apache", "apache$PRODUCT$tomcat_native", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
