{"CVE": "CVE-2017-7805", "CWE": ["CWE-416"], "DATE": "2018-06-11 21:29:10", "SCORE": 5.0, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.", "PRODUIT": "debian"}
