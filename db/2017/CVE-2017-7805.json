{"CVE": "CVE-2017-7805", "CWE": ["CWE-416"], "DATE": "2018-06-11T21:29:10.047000+00:00", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": null, "DESC": "During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "mozilla", "mozilla$PRODUCT$firefox", "mozilla$PRODUCT$thunderbird"]}
