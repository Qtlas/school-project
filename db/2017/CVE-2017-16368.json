This vulnerability leads to a stack-based buffer overflow condition in the internal Unicode string manipulation module. It is triggered by an invalid PDF file, where a crafted Unicode string causes an out of bounds memory access of a stack allocated buffer, due to improper checks when manipulating an offset of a pointer to the buffer. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability and achieve arbitrary code execution if they can effectively control the accessible memory.", "VENDOR": ["adobe", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat_dc", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat_reader", "adobe$PRODUCT$acrobat_reader_dc"]}
