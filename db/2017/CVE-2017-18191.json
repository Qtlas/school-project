By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume, an attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS header, resulting in a denial of service attack on the compute host. (The same code error also results in data loss, but that is not a vulnerability because the user loses their own data.) All Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected.", "VENDOR": ["openstack", "openstack$PRODUCT$nova", "redhat", "redhat$PRODUCT$openstack"]}
