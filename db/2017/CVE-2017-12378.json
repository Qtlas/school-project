The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms of .tar (Tape Archive) files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a checksum buffer over-read condition when ClamAV scans the malicious .tar file, potentially allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.", "VENDOR": ["clamav", "clamav$PRODUCT$clamav", "debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux"]}
