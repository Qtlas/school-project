The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP rate limiting protection on the GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate of TCP connections to the GUI. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the GUI to stop responding while the high rate of connections is in progress. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc81803.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
