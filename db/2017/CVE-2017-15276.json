When unpacking TAR archives, Content Server fails to verify the contents of an archive, which causes a path traversal vulnerability via symlinks. Because some files on the Content Server filesystem are security-sensitive, this leads to privilege escalation.", "VENDOR": ["opentext", "opentext$PRODUCT$documentum_content_server"]}
