An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_ak, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"ak\" parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability.", "VENDOR": ["insteon", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub_2245-222", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub_2245-222_firmware"]}
