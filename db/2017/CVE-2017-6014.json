If the packet size field in a packet header is null, the offset to read from will not advance, causing continuous attempts to read the same zero length packet. This will quickly exhaust all system memory.", "VENDOR": ["debian", "debian$PRODUCT$debian_linux", "wireshark", "wireshark$PRODUCT$wireshark"]}
