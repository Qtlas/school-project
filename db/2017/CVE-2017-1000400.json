This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only lists upstream and downstream projects that the current user has access to.", "VENDOR": ["jenkins", "jenkins$PRODUCT$jenkins"]}
