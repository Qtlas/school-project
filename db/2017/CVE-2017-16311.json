Specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. In cmd UpdateCheck, at 0x9d01bb64, the value for the `type` key is copied using `strcpy` to the buffer at `$sp+0x270`.This buffer is 16 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.", "PRODUIT": ["insteon", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub", "insteon$PRODUCT$hub_firmware"]}
