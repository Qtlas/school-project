{"CVE": "CVE-2017-20198", "CWE": ["CWE-732"], "DATE": "2025-07-23T14:15:32", "CVSS": {}, "METRIC": {}, "TITLE": "DC/OS Marathon UI < 1.9.0 Unauthenticated RCE via Docker Mount Abuse", "DESC": "The Marathon UI in DC/OS < 1.9.0 allows unauthenticated users to deploy arbitrary Docker containers. Due to improper restriction of volume mount configurations, attackers can deploy a container that mounts the host's root filesystem (/) with read/write privileges. When using a malicious Docker image, the attacker can write to /etc/cron.d/ on the host, achieving arbitrary code execution with root privileges. This impacts any system where the Docker daemon honors Marathon container configurations without policy enforcement.", "VENDOR": []}
