{"CVE": "CVE-2017-6678", "CWE": ["CWE-399", "CWE-755"], "DATE": "2017-06-26 07:29:00", "SCORE": 7.8, "METRIC": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C", "TITLE": "", "DESC": "A vulnerability in the ingress UDP packet processing functionality of Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software 19.2 through 21.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause both control function (CF) instances on an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of user-supplied data by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to the distributed instance (DI) network addresses of both CF instances on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unhandled error condition on the affected system, which would cause the CF instances to reload and consequently cause the entire VPC to reload, resulting in the disconnection of all subscribers and a DoS condition on the affected system. This vulnerability can be exploited via IPv4 traffic only. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc01665 CSCvc35565.", "PRODUIT": ["cisco", "cisco$PRODUCT$virtualized_packet_core"]}
