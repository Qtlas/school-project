The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted.", "PRODUIT": ["stashcat", "stashcat$PRODUCT$heinekingmedia"]}
