For authentication, the user password is hashed directly with SHA-512 without a salt or another key-derivation mechanism to enable a secure secret for authentication. Moreover, only the first 32 bytes of the hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow-table attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash.", "PRODUIT": "stashcat"}
