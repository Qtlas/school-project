The form validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which could result in secrets being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default configurations of Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these log files. Form validation for <f:password/> is now always sent via POST, which is typically not logged.", "PRODUIT": ["jenkins", "jenkins$PRODUCT$jenkins"]}
