For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.", "VENDOR": ["nodejs", "nodejs$PRODUCT$node.js", "openssl", "openssl$PRODUCT$openssl"]}
