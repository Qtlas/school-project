You can use this page as a web shell essentially to execute commands, though you get no feedback client-side from the web application: if the command is valid, it executes. An example is the wget command. The page that allows this has been confirmed in firmware as old as 2006.", "PRODUIT": ["ribboncommunications", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4550", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4552", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4601", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4700", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4750", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4800", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4806", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_4808", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_7301", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_7400", "ribboncommunications$PRODUCT$edgemarc_firmware"]}
