All affected SSLV versions act as weak oracles according the oracle classification used in the ROBOT research paper. A remote attacker, who has captured a pre-recorded SSL session inspected by SSLV, can establish multiple millions of crafted SSL connections to the target and obtain the session keys required to decrypt the pre-recorded SSL session.", "PRODUIT": "broadcom"}
