The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not assign a new session identifier to a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session identifier to connect to the software through the web-based GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14583.", "PRODUIT": "cisco"}
